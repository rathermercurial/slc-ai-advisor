## Section 3: Improving Your Impact Model

**Tag line: "Make your theory of change real"**

### Bridge from Customer Model

Having worked through improving your customer model. Now let's focus on your impact model. 

`[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas - highlight Impact Model section]`

### A Note on Impact Methodologies

Before we dive in, an important caveat.

There are many different approaches to mapping and modeling impact. 

Depending on the field you're in and the partners you work with, there may be specific impact methodologies already being used.

If you're working in a context where a specific methodology is expected or required, use that approach. Consistency and context-specific relevance matter.

The model we use in the Social Lean Canvas the best general model. It is the most generally useful one across most contexts. But the improvement ideas that we are going to work through here are applicable to any model that you are using.

The idea is to have a solid approach without getting bogged down with too much detail. We're walking a line: developing an effective approach that's good enough to validate, without over investing in detail. 

### Quick Diagnostic Check

Let's start with a quick check. Ask yourself these questions about your impact model:

Can you clearly articulate the causal chain from your activities to outcomes to impact?

Does your logic hold up under scrutiny?

Is it realistic that your activities will generate the outcomes you predict?


`[VISUAL TEXT: clear causal chain? | logic holds? | micro + macro impact?]`

If you're hesitating on any of these, your impact model probably needs work. Red flags include vague outcome statements, fuzzy logic and surface level generalizations about the issue.



### Impact Model Fundamentals

Your impact model is the causal chain that shows how your work creates the impact you exist to create.

In the model we use for the social lean canvas it follows this structure:
1. You start with the Issue - the specific social or environmental problem you're addressing. 
2. Then Participants - the people directly involved in your activities. 
3. Then Activities - the actions taken by or with participants. 
4. These generate Short-term Outcomes, 
5. Which build into Medium-term Outcomes, 
6. Which create Long-term Outcomes, 
7. Which ultimately achieve your Impact - the sustained change that aligns with your purpose.

`[MAIN PANEL: Impact Model canvas showing flow from Issue to Impact]`

There are two layers you need to achieve:

**Micro impact** - immediate, measurable changes. Your activities generate short-term outcomes that you can see and track quickly.

**Macro impact** - sustained systemic change. Medium-term and long-term outcomes that build over years, creating lasting transformation.

`[VISUAL TEXT: micro = immediate changes | macro = systemic transformation]`

A common trap is focusing only on immediate outputs while neglecting long-term systemic change. Your impact model needs to show both.

Many of you will have a back-of-napkin impact model from your first pass through the canvas. That's fine. From here, you can tighten the model. If you're an existing nonprofit creating a social enterprise, you might already have a well-developed impact model. Either way, the goal is the same: get it good enough to start validating.

# Assess Your Impact Model

Let's assess where your model might be weak. We'll look through four lenses.

### Fill in the Detail

If your impact model is still a rough sketch, flesh out enough of it so you can see and discuss how it works.

At this stage, you don't need every detail. But you need enough specificity to test the logic. You need to be able to explain: "We do these activities with these participants, which creates these short-term outcomes, which build to these medium-term outcomes, which over time generate these long-term outcomes and this ultimate impact."

You'll validate this later, but it has to look like it could work. It has to seem realistic on paper anyway.

### 1. Test the Logic

Does the causal chain actually hold up?

Start with the issue. Is this what you really think it is? Have you accurately diagnosed the problem, or are you addressing a symptom rather than a root cause?

Then the participants. Will they respond the way you expect them to? Are you making assumptions about their motivations, their capacity, their willingness to engage?

Then the activities. Will these actions actually generate the chain of outcomes you predict?

`[VISUAL TEXT: issue correct? | participants respond? | activities work?]`

Do research to test this logic. What have others learned? What does the academic literature say? What do experts in your field observe?

And be honest about what you don't know. It's better to identify weak logic now than to discover it after you've invested time and money.

### 2. Systems Thinking and Complexity Science Lens

Nothing happens in isolation. In the past, there have been many failures where people tried to solve a problem in isolation, only to have it backfire spectacularly.

You need to see the bigger picture. Use both systems thinking and complexity science perspectives.

`[MAIN PANEL: Simple system diagram showing interconnections]`

**Systems thinking asks:**

What is the larger system your impact operates within? Your issue doesn't exist in a vacuum. What surrounds it?

What different factors contribute to the problem? Multiple causes, multiple influences, multiple actors.

What activities will drive long-term impact on this issue? Both the activities your impact model will implement and those that others will do that share influence on the issue.

What unintended consequences could result from your activities? Systems are interconnected. Pull one lever and something predictable happens elsewhere.

**Complexity science adds:**

Systems are dynamic, non-linear, and adaptive. They don't behave in simple cause-and-effect ways.

Small interventions in the right places can create outsized change. These are called leverage points in the system.

Emergent properties means you can't predict outcomes just from looking at activities/inputs alone. The whole system creates results that are more than the sum of its parts.

Feedback loops show how outcomes reinforce or dampen activities over time. Virtuous cycles or vicious cycles.

`[VISUAL TEXT: interconnected | leverage points | emergent effects | feedback loops]`

Tony's Chocolonely in the example library demonstrates this well. They're not just working with individual farmers. They're intervening at multiple points in the cocoa system - digital tracking, premium pricing, transparency campaigns, industry advocacy, licensing their model to competitors. Each creates leverage. Together they're trying to drive systemic industry transformation.

### 3. Efficiency Lens

Is your impact model the most effective and efficient way to generate the outcomes you're trying to achieve?

Sometimes we get so enamored with our ideas that we miss better approaches.

A counter-intuitive example came out of a domestic violence program that spent years working with women victims. They invested in helping them build support groups. Learn to sew. Start small businesses. They tried many different interventions.

But in the end, they figured out that helping their husbands find jobs was the most efficient way to reduce the harm these women were suffering and create positive long-term outcomes.

`[VISUAL TEXT: years of victim services → husband employment = most efficient]`

The intervention that actually worked was upstream and adjacent to the obvious solution. Not what they expected. But more effective and more efficient. 

Use this efficiency lens. Ask yourself:

What's the root cause you're actually addressing?

Are there more efficient intervention points in the system?

Are your activities FEELING impactful but not actually driving longterm change?

This efficiency lens connects to your economic model as well: more efficient impact activities means better economics. If you can achieve the same outcomes with fewer activities, lower costs, simpler delivery - your business model becomes stronger.

Toast Ale shows this well. Rather than running education campaigns about food waste, they intervene at the recovery point - turning surplus bread into beer. Direct waste reduction, immediate emissions avoided, and they fund environmental charities with the profits. Check out their impact model in the example library.

### 4. Third Party Perspective

Get outside perspectives on all these assessment angles.

Talk with advisors and experts in your impact area. But critically, talk with people who have lived experience of the issues you're approaching.

`[VISUAL TEXT: advisors | experts | lived experience]`

People with lived experience have deep insights that might be non-obvious. Perspectives you can't get any other way. Their input is critical.

Also talk with organizations already doing similar work. They'll have learned things that can save you years of struggle.

Ask, where are the weaknesses in my model? What am I missing? What would you do differently?

It's a red flag if you are only getting input from people who think like you. You need perspectives that challenge your assumptions.

# Strategic Improvement Approaches

Now let's look at how to improve your impact model. Here are five strategic approaches.

### Copy from Others

If you're trying to address a real problem, you don't have to do all of this from scratch.

Many organizations will have already approached each piece of your impact model before. Perhaps in different communities or geographies. Look at how they're approaching the issue. There will be many angles on how you could do this.


And if you don't understand something, call them up and ask. They'll usually be happy to talk through what they've learned and give you advice.

Use AI research tools to find:

Who's already doing similar work? What approaches are they taking? What seems to be working? What hasn't worked? Where the struggles have been?

What academic research, longitudinal studies, or evaluation reports prove aspects of your impact logic?

`[VISUAL TEXT: who's doing this? | what works? | what proves it?]`

This research can put your impact model on a solid footing and save you from guessing wildly about what might work.

### Find Leverage Points in the System

If you can map the system that the issue is occurring in, you can look for leverage points in different parts of it.

You might find that intervening earlier, or in an adjacent part of the system, will be much more effective.

This is where complexity thinking helps. Small interventions in the right places create outsized change.

The domestic violence example showed this - employment intervention upstream was more effective than victim support downstream.

Toast Ale shows it too - intervening at the food waste recovery point rather than trying to change consumer behavior at the end of the chain.

Where in your system are the high-leverage intervention points?

### Partner to Reduce Load

Having a robust approach to impact can take a lot of work and focus. Consider how you might partner with other organizations to reduce some of this load from your business model.

Perhaps you could team up with an organization that's already delivering the activities you plan to deliver. You could fund them to expand their activities rather than do it yourself.

Perhaps you could partner with an organization that's holding one piece of a solution while you hold another piece. Collectively you might be more effective and also reduce costs.

`[VISUAL TEXT: fund expansion | collaborative delivery | shared solution]`

When does it make sense to partner versus do it yourself? If your impact activities are core to your value proposition or competitive advantage, you probably need to do them yourself. If they're necessary but don't make your model, partnership might work better.

And remember the connection to your economic model. Partnership can dramatically reduce your cost structure.

### Stay Experimental and Flexible

Accept that you won't have all the answers. Like with the rest of the business model, you'll discover them in time through experimentation.

Don't lock down your impact model prematurely. You need to be able to respond to learning and pivot the impact model when you discover something that will be more effective.

Keep it light enough to be able to evolve it.

The balance is: enough structure to test your assumptions, enough flexibility to pivot when you learn something new.

### Prioritization Framework

You've just seen five approaches. Which should you use when?

Start with "copy from others." Learn from existing work. Don't reinvent what's already been figured out.

Then use the "systems lens and leverage points" thinking. Find more effective interventions.

Then consider "partnership" to reduce the load on your business model.

Keep "experimental and flexible" as an ongoing mindset throughout.

And use "AI tools" at every stage to fill gaps in your knowledge.

# The Improvement Process

Here's how to actually work through improving your impact model.

**First, gather input.** Talk with advisors, experts, and especially people with lived experience. Research organizations doing similar work. Use AI tools to fill gaps in your model. Review the example library for similar impact approaches.

**Second, work through systematically.** Follow your impact model canvas in order: Issue, then Participants, then Activities, then Short-term Outcomes, then Medium-term Outcomes, then Long-term Outcomes, then Impact.

For each box, based on the assessment lenses we just covered and the feedback you've gathered, brainstorm possible changes. Use AI to explore possibilities.

`[MAIN PANEL: Impact Model canvas with boxes highlighted in sequence]`

**Third, test ripple effects.** For each idea that looks promising, zoom out.

First, consider the impact model as a whole. Does this change strengthen the causal chain? Does it improve both micro and macro impact?

Then zoom out to your business model. How does this change affect your customer model? For example, different participants might mean different customers.

How does it affect your economic model? Different activities mean different costs. Partnership changes your cost structure.

Is the overall business model stronger with this change?

### Readiness Check

You're ready to move on when you can confidently answer these questions:

Can you articulate the causal chain with confidence - from activities through outcomes to impact?

Have you tested the logic with experts and people with lived experience?

Do you understand the larger system you're operating in?

Have you identified the most efficient intervention points?



`[VISUAL TEXT: confident logic | tested with experts | understand system | micro + macro]`

If yes, create a list of your core assumptions about this impact model. You'll need these when you start validating.

### Remember: You're Still Early

You're still in the early development of your business model. This doesn't have to be complete or perfect.

There will be lots more time to validate and evolve the impact model as you develop your venture. You'll learn things through testing that you can't know now.

But you want to make sure your impact model is good enough to start validating. There's no point in investing time and effort into testing something that just isn't good enough yet.

The goal is good enough to test, not perfect to launch.

Now let's move to your economic model.
