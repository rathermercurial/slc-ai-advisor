**[MAIN PANEL: Understanding Business model Design]**
**[MAIN PANEL: Empty Social Lean Canvas outline]**

**Script (spoken):**

Before we dive into filling in your business model in the Social Lean Canvas, it's important that we understand what a business model actually is and how the journey of creating a successful one actually works. If you're considering leaving your job and pivoting to purpose, getting these fundamentals right isn't optional—it's critical.

When you're bootstrapping solo or with a small team to build a venture, you can't afford to waste time, money, or energy guessing at a business model. You don't have the safety net of a large team or investor capital to cover mistakes. Getting the business model fundamentals right is your foundation for the journey ahead.

**[VISUAL TEXT: The fundamentals  matter]**

You're about to work through the Core content on business model design— these are the universal frameworks that apply to any venture. The Core Framework will walk you through what a business model is, why design beats guesswork, and the critical distinction between startups and businesses.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Core Framework ahead | Universal principles | P2P application follows]**

After the Core content, we'll come back and talk about what makes Purpose Pivot Ventures different from other paths to venture building - like high-growth startups and social enterprises , which is covered in the core content. We'll also introduce resources you can return to throughout the program to make sense of your journey.

## P2P COMMENTARY

<span style="color:green"> p2p 3.1 understanding-business-model-design2.webm</span> 


**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Pivot to Purpose Ventures"]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just walked you through business model fundamentals—what a model is, why design matters, and the startup journey from search to validation to execution. These are universal principles. Now let's talk about what makes a Purpose Pivot Venture different and why this moment is ripe with opportunity.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Universal principles | P2P distinctions]**

### What's different when you're pivoting to purpose?

[VISUAL TEXT: What's different when you're pivoting to purpose?]

**[MAIN PANEL: Three-part visual - Startup path vs P2P path vs Job replacement] (create new - animates with sections)**

There are three things that distinguish small, purpose driven ventures like yours from other paths you might take.

#### Different from a High-Growth Startup

First, a Purpose Pivot Venture is different from building a high-growth startup. The traditional startup path is straightforward—raise money, build a team, scale fast, eventually sell the company so investors can make their return. That path exists, and you can take it if it fits your goals. But it's not what we're focused on here.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Traditional startup | Raise capital | Scale fast | Exit]**

A Purpose Pivot Venture might stay small or grow slowly. You might take no investment and end up with 100% ownership. You might never sell it. You might stay solo or build a really small team, leveraging AI and other modern tools to skip the high-growth, investment-driven approach entirely.

Small by design is legitimate. Slow growth is fine. You're building a machine that serves your life, not serving a machine that demands hypergrowth.

**[VISUAL TEXT: P2P| Stay small | Grow slowly | Keep ownership | Leverage AI]**

**Tag line:** **Not all ventures scale big.**

---

#### More Than Money

Second, a Purpose Pivot Venture is not about business and money above everything. Pivoting to purpose is about building something that helps you act and feel more in line with your values than you do in your current corporate job—or wherever you are right now.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Values alignment | Integrate who you are with what you do]**

You're integrating how you want to be in the world with how you sustain yourself financially and generate wealth. This might manifest as a full social enterprise with a comprehensive theory of change driving your venture. Or it might be commitments you make to yourself about how you want to show up as you do this work. Either way, this purpose focus makes a Purpose Pivot Venture something you can fully commit your whole self to.

We'll explore the spectrum of purpose in more depth when we get to the Purpose section. 

**Tag line:** **Align values and work.**

---

#### Not Just Another Type of Job

Third, what we are talking about here is not about creating a job for yourself—essentially taking your existing job and removing all the security it offers. It's not about becoming a freelancer where you trade one kind of dissatisfaction—no meaning, no control—for another—uncertainty about where the next paycheck comes from.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Not freelancing | Not job replacement | Business ownership]**

Pivoting to purpose is about harnessing the power of business ownership to find meaningful ways to contribute to the world that can bring you financial independence. You're building a machine that generates freedom—not just income, but the ability to make choices about your time, your work, and your life.

This is why the business model design work matters so much. You're not just finding clients. You're designing a system that creates value, delivers it efficiently, captures revenue, and manages costs—all while aligned with your purpose.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Build a machine | Freedom + Income | Meaningful contribution]**

**Tag line:** **Ownership creates freedom.**

### Business Model Fundamentals for P2P

**[MAIN PANEL: The four components - Create | Deliver | Capture | Manage] (take from core)**

The Core Framework showed you the four pieces of any business model—create value, deliver value, capture value, manage costs. Purpose Pivot Ventures still need all four. Whether you're building a micro-SaaS product, offering productized services, or creating a content-driven community, these pieces must work together. The scale might be smaller, the approach more automated, but the logic is the same.

And if you're aiming for measurable impact beyond your own livelihood, you add the impact dimension—the fifth piece that sits alongside the commercial model.

**[VISUAL TEXT: PPV = Create | Deliver | Capture | Manage + Impact]**

**Tag line:** **Same pieces, your scale.**

---

### Why Design Matters for Solo Founders

The Core content made the case that design beats guesswork. For Purpose Pivot Ventures, this matters even more. When you're solo or with a small team, you don't have a safety net of people to catch mistakes or pivot quickly when something breaks. You're bootstrapping—likely while still employed—so every decision counts. You can't afford to spend six months building the wrong thing.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Solo = No safety net | Every choice counts]**

This is where **Honest Hustle** comes in. We're not talking about internet hustle culture—growth hacks and hype. We're talking about designing your business model with intention, testing it rigorously, and building something that makes money _and_ makes sense for the life you want. Design your model deliberately. Test it. Prove it works. Then scale it.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Honest Hustle | Design with intention]**

**Tag line:** **Design with intention.**

### The Startup Journey: Search Phase and Employment

**[MAIN PANEL: Startup Journey diagram - Search → Validate → Execute]**

Now, the startup journey. This is where things get specifically relevant to Purpose Pivot Ventures.

The Core Framework showed you the search phase—where you're testing assumptions and validating your model. This phase is perfect for evenings and weekends if you need to keep your existing job. You don't have to quit on day one. In fact, you shouldn't.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Search phase | Evenings + weekends | Stay employed]**

If you need to keep your existing job, keep it during the search phase. Only make the leap once your model is validated and generating meaningful revenue. This removes massive financial pressure and lets you validate thoroughly rather than rushing because your runway is burning. Different people are in different situations, but if staying employed is an option, use it strategically.

Modern AI tools make solo validation faster and more feasible than ever before. You can do customer research, build MVPs, and test core assumptions with tools that didn't exist two years ago. We'll cover specific tools in later sections, but know that being solo doesn't mean being stuck. You have leverage that previous generations didn't have.

**[VISUAL TEXT: AI tools enable solo validation]**

**Tag line:** **Search while employed.**

---

### Founder First: You ARE the Team

The Core content emphasized "Founders First"—founders must own the key decisions early on. For Purpose Pivot Ventures, this becomes "Founder First." You _are_ the team in the early stage. You can't outsource customer discovery or value proposition design. You have to learn directly from customers and make the calls yourself.

AI tools can augment you significantly. You're solo, but you're not doing it with 1990s constraints. You make the calls, but you have powerful tools to help you execute.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Founder First | AI augments | You decide]**

**Tag line:** **Own the decisions.**

---

### Validation Pacing for P2P

Here's a critical mindset shift: slower validation is okay when you're keeping your job. The pressure isn't "validate in 12 weeks or die." It's "validate thoroughly, build confidence in the model, then make the leap." Better to take an extra three months proving the model works than quitting too early and failing under financial stress.

**Tag line:** **Validate thoroughly first.**

### Resources: Venture Typology and Example Libraries

**[
**Tag line:** "Six patterns, not six boxes"

[MAIN PANEL: Visual diagram showing 6 categories in a simple layout]

[VISUAL TEXT: 6 Common P2P Business Model Patterns]

When I look across the landscape of successful purpose pivots - solo founders and small teams building sustainable ventures - I see 6 common patterns emerging. These aren't rigid categories you have to fit into. Think of them as a pattern library - archetypes that can help you recognize what's working in the real world.

**1. Software & AI** Micro-SaaS products, AI copilots, developer tools, browser extensions - digital products that solve specific problems and can run with minimal ongoing involvement once built.

**2. Productized Services**  
Services packaged like products - design-as-a-service, automation retainers, AI agents handling specific workflows - where you systematize expert work so it scales without linear time investment.

**3. Consulting & Coaching** Expert guidance packaged efficiently - AI enablement consulting, fractional leadership, platform expertise, personal knowledge management coaching - where your specialized knowledge creates high value without requiring a large team.

**4. Content, Education & Community** Newsletter-led businesses, book-led businesses, podcast-led communities, online courses, cohort-based programs - where you build audience and monetize through multiple channels.

**5. Digital Goods & Commerce** Templates, creative assets, printables, data products, print-on-demand micro-brands - digital or digital-enabled physical products with high margins and low overhead.

**6. Local, Regenerative & Physical** Circular economy services, reusables-as-a-service, community sensor networks, urban mining - place-based or physically-grounded ventures often with strong regenerative or environmental purpose.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Pattern library, not personality test]**

The key thing to understand: different examples from these categories will be relevant to you at different times. As we work through your Customer Model, you might relate most to a Software & AI example. When we hit Economic Model, maybe a Productized Service example shows you a better cost structure approach. Use these as reference points and inspiration, not rigid templates.

If you want to go deeper into the venture typology - see more examples in each category, understand the common business model patterns within each - check out the venture typology deep dive. But for now, this overview is enough.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Patterns, not blueprints]**

### The Example Libraries

**Tag line:** "Learn from real ventures, not theory"

[MAIN PANEL: Split screen or toggle showing both library options]

[VISUAL TEXT: Two Example Libraries]

Throughout this program, you have access to two example libraries that show you real ventures using the Social Lean Canvas framework.

**The Core Example Library** contains purpose-driven ventures of all types - from fully-developed social enterprises with deep impact models to traditional businesses with strong purpose integration. These examples show the full range of what's possible with the framework and demonstrate how different ventures apply it. You'll find established companies like Patagonia alongside newer social innovations.

**The P2P Example Library** is specifically curated for ventures that fit the 6 patterns we just looked at. These are ventures built by solo founders or very small teams - the kinds of businesses you might recognize yourself in. Each one has a video walkthrough that shows you not just their completed canvas, but the story of how their business model works and why certain choices mattered.

[MAIN PANEL: Show one P2P example canvas - maybe DesignJoy or Plausible Analytics]

**[VISUAL TEXT: Example - DesignJoy]** (or whichever you choose)

Let me show you one quickly. This is DesignJoy - a productized design service that packages unlimited design work into a fixed monthly subscription. You can see their full Customer Model, Impact Model, Economic Model laid out. 

This is what you'll find for about a dozen P2P ventures - real businesses you can study section by section.

As we work through filling in your canvas, I'll point you to relevant examples. When we hit Customer Model, you might want to watch how Plausible Analytics identified their early adopters. When we get to Economic Model, you might look at how a content-led business structures their revenue streams differently than a SaaS product.



**[VISUAL TEXT: Use as reference points, not blueprints]**

Remember - these are reference points, not blueprints. Your venture will be unique. But seeing how others solved similar problems is invaluable.

### Moving Forward

**[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas outline]**

You've got the fundamentals now—what a business model is, why design matters, and how the startup journey works. You understand what makes Purpose Pivot Ventures different: not the high-growth startup path, more than just money, and building ownership rather than another job.


**[VISUAL TEXT: Prove it | Build confidence | Then leap]**

Next, we'll start filling in your Canvas, section by section. The typology and example libraries are there when you need them.
