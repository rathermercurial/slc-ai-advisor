- “Welcome to The Social Lean Canvas.”
    
- “This is where you take the ideas in your head and turn them into a clear, testable business model that can succeed.”
    
- “I’ll walk you through a set of simple steps to map what you know, suspect and haven’t yet articulated into a coherent model that fits on a single page.”
    
- “When you’ve completed your canvas you’ll have a one-page map of who you serve, how you create value, how you make money, and how you create impact.”

### **3. Who it’s for (short version)**

  

The Social Lean Canvas is for **purpose-driven ventures** – organisations that care about both:
- a **business model** – a money system that keeps the venture alive, and
- an **impact model** – a clear logic for the change you want to create in the world.

This can include social enterprises, community and indigenous ventures, co-operatives, non-profits with earned income, mission-led startups, solo ventures, and all the other, yet to be imagined ways we can use a business model to deliver social or environmental impact

If this is what you are working towards, then the social lean canvas is for you. 



---

### **4. What you’ll walk away with**

  

By the time you’ve finished Your Social Lean Canvas, you’ll have made sense of your ideas, you'll have:

- A **clear one-page map** of your venture – who you serve, how you create value, how you make money, and how you create impact.
    
- A **shared language** to talk about your idea with co-founders, funders, partners and supporters.
    
- And a **foundation** upon which you can build a clear strategy to take your venture forward.

### **5. Free & open + Build mention (one paragraph)**

  
The Social Lean Canvas is **free and open to everyone**
  

If, after you’ve done your canvas, you want more support to improve your model and design your strategy, there’s a follow-on program called **Build**. We charge a modest fee for Build to help sustain this work. But we also know that "modest fee" for one person could be a month's salary for another, so if you want to join Build but can’t afford it to pay for it, we've got you covered. No one misses out because of money.  

People who can pay for Build effectively **pay it forward** – helping fund places for those who can’t afford it, and keeping the Social Lean Canvas accessible to everyone who needs it.

### **7. Who uses the canvas (full version)**

  The Social Lean Canvas is for ventures that have **both**:

- a **business model** – a way to earn money to grow and sustain your venture
    
- an **impact model** – clear logic for how your activities will create positive change in the world
      

There are lots of different ways this can show up in the world. You might think of yourself as a **social enterprise**, a **community or indigenous enterprise**, a **co-operative**, a **non-profit with earned income**, or a **mission-led startup or solo venture of some sort**. All of these have a mechanism for money to flow through them to make them financially sustainable, and even profitable, while having a social or environmental mission. All can work on the canvas.

  We’ve deliberately designed the SLC so it isn’t tied to any one legal structure or narrow definition. If you have a way to earn money _and_ a way to deliver impact, the canvas is for you.

  Rather than getting lost in labels, we refer to all of these kinds of organizations combining business and impact models as simply **purpose-driven ventures**.

### **8. Why purpose-driven ventures matter**

Traditional businesses can't be relied on to solve the problems that the world faces, and increasingly they are the cause of many of these problems. 

At the same time, a whole new set of tools are arriving that make building purpose aligned organizations easier and more able to compete with traditional companies. Digital platforms, AI and other technologies are making it possible for purpose driven organizations to succeed in ways that were impossible in the past. 

There is a new playbook emerging for purpose driven ventures to harness technology, innovation, capital and networks in ways that have only been available to big traditional businesses. 

There’s already a rich history of purpose-driven organisations to learn from, and every day brings new examples of people using the tools of business to create positive change. 

The Social Lean Canvas exists to give these ventures a better shot at surviving and thriving in our shifting landscape.

### **9. About the Social Lean Canvas (origin & purpose)**

  

### **What is the Social Lean Canvas?**

  

But succeeding with this is complex and hard - most startups fail and the stats are even worse for purpose driven startups... where you have to figure out how to make the economics work (which is hard on it's own) AND figure out how to have a positive impact on the world at the same time. And it's not good enough to just rely on feel good vibes, you need to be able to prove that you are making a difference. 

Our goal with the Social Lean Canvas is to meaningfully increase the number of purpose-driven ventures that succeed – and, in our own small way, nudge the world in a better direction.

We created the Social Lean Canvas in 2013 and have been evolving it ever since as a **free, open-source tool**. It’s been used by **thousands of ventures**, accelerator and incubator programs, universities, NGOs and community organisations around the world.

  The canvas is designed to:

- **Demystify venture building** – by breaking it into a small set of core questions.
    
- It gives you a **simple framework and shared language** for your idea, so you can have better conversations with co-founders, partners, funders and stakeholders.
    
- And I gives you the confidence to move forward knowing that you can understand and prioritize the important steps that you need to take. 
    

It’s about creating coherence out of confusion and giving you a solid foundation to move from.

 In fact, once you have created your canvas, it will seem crazy to think you would have ever tried to build a venture without first mapping and making sense of it.  Even though that's what most people end up doing.

### **10. How it works (the three models)**

  

The social lean canvas process builds out of startup best practice, first sketching the model that you think can work and then validating the riskiest pieces of it with real customers and stakeholders. And then based on this learning, evolving the model into something that can succeed.
  
The canvas starts by walking you through defining your purpose,
- the thing that you're here to do, 
- the thing that animates you. 
- The thing that keeps you focused and stops you becoming just another company 

It then breaks your venture down into three main models, 
- your customer model, 
- your impact model, 
- and your economic model.  
  
These three models need to fit together for your venture to succeed, but they can be worked on independently to make them easier to understand. 


Firstly you map your **customer model** – the part of your venture that creates value for customers: 

- **Customer segments** – who you serve
- **Jobs to be done** – what need of theirs are you serving
- **Unique value proposition** – why they would choose _you_.
- And **Solution** – what you actually deliver them

This can be:
- **Simple** – one clear product, one obvious customer.
- **More complex** – multiple customers (e.g. users vs payers vs partners).
- **Very complex** – multi-sided platforms or Web3 protocols where you might have customers, contributors, investors and community members all playing different roles in the model.
  
The canvas helps you get all of that out of your head and onto the page in a way you can actually work with.

Next is your **impact model** – your theory of change:

- How will what you do lead to real, provable change over time?
- What needs to happen in the short, medium and long term?
- And How will you know if it’s working?

This gets you beyond things that just _feel_ good.
It forces you to be honest about whether your activities connect to outcomes in a way that can be measured, tested and improved.


And then, Finally, you map your **economic model** – how money flows through your venture. This is:
- **Channels** – how people find you and how you deliver your solution to them.
- **Revenue** – where the money actually comes from and in what form.
- **Costs** – what it takes to deliver your product and your impact.
- And **Advantage** – why this is sustainable and defensible over time.

The goal is to see clearly whether your model can support **growth and sustainability**, not just survive in the short term, but thrive in a lasting way. 
  



#### **Using examples as you go**

You don’t have to start from a blank page.

As you work through the canvas, you can lean on the **venture example library** – collections of example canvases for different sectors, impact areas, geographies and founder types.

Seeing how ventures similar to yours express their customer, impact and economic models is a fast way to:
- understand how the canvas works, and
- spot patterns and options you might not have considered.

#### **Bringing it together**

These three models – **customer, impact and economic** – plus your purpose, all fit together in your Social Lean Canvas.

They give you an integrated view of your idea as a business model that can be both **financially sustainable** and **genuinely impactful** – a model you can then improve, test and, if it holds up, start to build from.

### **11. How long will this take?**

  How long will this take? 
  It depends where you’re starting from.

If your idea is fairly simple, and you’re already clear about how it works, you might be able to do your first Social Lean Canvas in a **couple of hours**.

If there’s a lot that still isn’t clear yet, it will take longer. This isn't a problem though – it’s the point. The canvas is designed to surface the questions you _haven’t_ properly answered yet, or didn't even know you needed to ask.

A few important things to keep in mind:
- **It’s not a race.**
    The goal isn’t to “finish your canvas as fast as possible”, it’s to think properly about the questions it raises.
- **You might be less clear than you think.**
    It’s common to start the canvas feeling confident, and then discover gaps and contradictions as you go. That can feel uncomfortable, but it’s a gift.
- **Better now than later.**
    It’s much better to learn that parts of your model don’t quite make sense while everything still lives on a single page, than after you’ve hired people, raised money or launched something you can’t easily change.
    
So give this the time it needs. Decisions that you make now as a result of getting really  clear about what you are doing, will pay you back many times over the life of your venture. 

You can do this in one sitting or in chunks, depending on what you need.

I’ll keep it real and walk you through each idea and each step on video, so you’re not staring at an empty template wondering what to do next.

### **12. Build & the pay-it-forward model (full version)**

  Once you’ve finished your Social Lean Canvas, you may have everything you need to move forward on your own.

But if you want more structure and support to **improve your model and design a strategy**, that’s what **Build** is for.

**Build** is a follow-on program for people who already have a completed Social Lean Canvas and want help to start making it real. In Build, there are 2 main pieces:
- **Improving your business model** – you stress-test your canvas, explore alternatives, and and make your business model stronger.
- **And then designing a strategy to take it forward** – you turn your model into an executable plan
    
- This lays out your road map for the immediate, short-term and medium-term timeframes.  

We keep the Social Lean Canvas program **free and open** by charging a **modest fee** for Build. But we ensure that if anyone can't afford this that this isn't a barrier. 
- If you can afford to pay for Build, **you pay**.
- If you can’t, let us know and we'll ensure there is space for you.

- People who can pay for Build help fund places for people who can’t.
- Together, they also help fund the work needed to keep the Social Lean Canvas free and open to everyone, and to keep improving these programs over time.


The goal is to make the whole system **financially sustainable**, while making sure that **no one misses out on this because of money**.
