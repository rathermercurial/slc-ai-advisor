# Design Joy Research Report


---

## 1. Description

Design Joy is a subscription-based design agency founded in 2017 by Brett Williams, a UX/UI designer who previously worked as a creative director at Transdev North America. Williams launched Design Joy as a one-person operation that revolutionized the design industry with its subscription-based model, and to this day, Designjoy is run entirely by Brett without hiring extra designers or outsourcing work. The enterprise operates as a productized design service, offering unlimited design requests for a flat monthly fee to agencies, startups, and entrepreneurs. Design Joy was inspired by Design Pickle, a larger design agency, and Williams decided to take the risk of starting his own design company, first launching on Product Hunt. The business model focuses on delivering high-quality design work with an average turnaround time of 48 hours, generating over $1.2 million annually as a solo operation.

## 2. Purpose

**Purpose Detailed Analysis**: Design Joy's purpose centers on solving the reliability and cost problems businesses face when working with traditional freelancers and agencies. The company aims to replace unreliable freelancers and expensive agencies for one flat monthly fee, with designs delivered so fast customers won't want to go anywhere else. Williams recognized that businesses needed consistent, high-quality design services without the unpredictability of project-based pricing or the overhead of hiring full-time designers. The venture was started to democratize access to premium design services while maintaining the flexibility and personalized attention that larger agencies often lack.

**Purpose Synopsis**: Eliminate design service uncertainty by providing reliable, premium-quality design work through predictable subscription pricing.

## 3. Customer Model

### Customers

**Customer Types**: Design Joy serves primarily one customer type - businesses seeking design services. However, within this customer type, there are distinct segments:

**Customer Segments**: 
- Agencies (who resell design services to their clients)
- Startups (needing design work for product development and marketing)
- Entrepreneurs/solopreneurs (requiring various design assets for their ventures)
- SaaS companies (needing ongoing design support)
- Small to medium businesses (requiring periodic design work)

**Early Adopters**: Brett initially launched Design Joy on Product Hunt and attracted early clients through his existing network and the platform's visibility, with the business gaining traction from agencies and startups in the SaaS technology space.

**Customers Detailed Analysis**: Design Joy targets businesses that need consistent, high-quality design work but want to avoid the unpredictability of freelance relationships or the high costs of traditional agencies. Brett operates in the broad SaaS technology space, which he acknowledges is harder to get into nowadays compared to more specific niches. The customer base includes notable clients like Nectar, Failory, Flowbase, Xfinity, and Beehiiv, indicating a focus on established businesses with substantial design budgets.

**Customers Synopsis**: Agencies, startups, and established businesses in the SaaS/technology space requiring reliable, ongoing design services.

### Jobs to be Done

**Jobs to be Done Detailed Analysis**: Design Joy customers are "hiring" the service to solve multiple interconnected jobs: eliminating the uncertainty and timeline unpredictability of freelance designers, avoiding the high overhead and inflexibility of traditional agencies, and accessing senior-level design quality without hiring full-time staff. The psychological need being fulfilled extends beyond simple design creation to providing peace of mind through predictable costs, reliable delivery, and quality assurance. Customers also value the ability to scale their design capacity up or down without long-term commitments.

**Jobs to be Done Synopsis**: Provide predictable, high-quality design capacity without the risks and overhead of traditional design resources.

### Existing Alternatives

**Existing Alternatives Detailed Analysis**: Before Design Joy, customers primarily used freelance platforms (Upwork, 99designs), traditional design agencies, or attempted to hire in-house designers. Alternatives include competitors like Penji (starting at $499/month), Kimp ($559/month), and other subscription-based design services. Some customers also use "do nothing" approaches, relying on basic templates or internal non-designer staff for design work.

**Existing Alternatives Synopsis**: Freelance platforms, traditional agencies, in-house hiring, or lower-cost design subscription competitors.

### Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

**UVP Detailed Analysis**: Design Joy's unique value proposition lies in its subscription-based model offering cost predictability, unparalleled flexibility for unlimited design tasks, and different subscription tiers accommodating diverse business requirements and budgets. Unlike competitors, Design Joy provides direct access to the founder, ensuring consistent design quality and vision. The service maintains a strict 48-hour delivery schedule with less than 1% of requests failing to meet that timeline.

**UVP Synopsis**: Premium design quality with guaranteed 48-hour delivery, unlimited revisions, and direct founder involvement.

### Solution

**Solution Detailed Analysis**: Design Joy offers unlimited design requests through a subscription model, delivered one at a time with an average turnaround of two business days, managed through Trello boards for easy request management. The service covers landing pages, mobile apps, logos, branding, slide decks, Webflow development, social media graphics, icons, brand guides, and blog graphics, but excludes 3D modeling, animated graphics, document design, complex packaging, and extensive print design.

**Solution Synopsis**: Unlimited design requests delivered via subscription with 48-hour average turnaround and Trello-based project management.

## 4. Impact Model

Based on the research, Design Joy does not have a clearly defined social or environmental impact model. The venture operates primarily as a for-profit business service without explicit social or environmental mission statements. While the business may have indirect impacts through supporting other businesses' success and enabling entrepreneurship, these are byproducts of the commercial service rather than intentional impact objectives. The company focuses on delivering business value through efficient design services rather than pursuing measurable social or environmental outcomes.

## 5. Economic Model

### Channels

**Channels Detailed Analysis**: Design Joy uses multiple acquisition channels including social media (particularly Twitter/X where Brett has built a significant following), word-of-mouth referrals, and his "Productize Yourself" course which doubles as a marketing channel. The original launch was through Product Hunt, which provided initial visibility. Distribution is entirely digital, with project management through Trello and communication via established digital channels.

**Channels Synopsis**: Social media marketing, word-of-mouth referrals, educational content, and digital project management platforms.

### Revenue

**Revenue Detailed Analysis**: Design Joy operates on a subscription model with pricing starting at $4,995 monthly for the standard plan (one active request) and higher pricing for the Pro plan (two concurrent active requests). The business generates approximately $1.5M annually ($150,000+ monthly recurring revenue) from design services, plus additional revenue from the "Productize Yourself" course.

**Revenue Synopsis**: Monthly subscriptions starting at $4,995, generating $150,000+ monthly recurring revenue.

### Costs

**Costs Detailed Analysis**: As a one-person operation, Design Joy has minimal overhead costs. Primary expenses likely include software subscriptions (Figma, Trello, Memberstack, Webflow), payment processing fees through Stripe, and personal operational costs. Brett uses minimal tools: Webflow for the website, Memberstack for recurring payments, Trello for client request management, and Figma as the primary design tool. The business avoids costs associated with employees, office space, or outsourcing.

**Costs Synopsis**: Software subscriptions, payment processing fees, and minimal operational overhead as a one-person business.

### Advantage

**Advantage Detailed Analysis**: Design Joy's primary advantages include Brett's solopreneurship model allowing full control over quality, a lean operation that outperforms many multi-employee agencies, and the strength of independence enabling high standards maintenance. The business benefits from being first-to-market in the subscription design space, establishing premium positioning and brand recognition. Brett's unique ability to maintain speed and quality simultaneously creates a barrier to entry, as he notes he "can't find designers who can work as quickly as me".

**Advantage Synopsis**: First-mover advantage in subscription design, unmatched speed-quality combination, and premium brand positioning through founder expertise.

## 6. Key Metrics

**Key Metrics Detailed Analysis**: Design Joy tracks monthly recurring revenue (currently $150,000+), maintains a delivery success rate of 99%+ for the 48-hour timeline, and manages 6-7 active clients with 2-3 additional paused subscriptions at any given time. The business likely monitors client satisfaction through retention rates, project completion metrics, and revision requests. Revenue growth, client acquisition costs, and capacity utilization are key performance indicators for the subscription model.

**Key Metrics Synopsis**: Monthly recurring revenue, 48-hour delivery success rate, client retention, and subscription capacity utilization.
