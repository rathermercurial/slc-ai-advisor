## Section 5.1.2: Assessing Your Stage

**Tag line: "Know where you are"**

### Where Are You Now?

The first step to figuring out your strategy - where you go next - is to work out where you currently are.

The Venture Stage Map gives you a simple set of heuristics to understand where you are on the venture development journey.

`[MAIN PANEL: Venture Stage Map diagram]`

It breaks the journey into four simple stages:

**Idea Stage** - you're starting out with a mostly untested new idea.

**Early Stage** - you have some core validation experiments done, maybe a prototype, and have some confidence that you're on the right track.

**Growth Stage** - you have a product or service in market and are starting to deliver revenue and outcomes from your impact model.

**Scale Stage** - you have validated your business model and are ready to scale your venture in a structured, professional way.

### Four Dimensions of Development

The map splits out your customer, impact, and economic models. It also includes an organization section that tracks your organizational development.

`[MAIN PANEL: Highlight the four columns - Customer Model, Impact Model, Economic Model, Organisation]`

This allows you to map your progress across these four dimensions and lets you see when they might be out of balance.

### The Balance Problem

Here's what happens when things get out of balance.

Some entrepreneurs who come from a finance background might over-index on developing the economic model components of the canvas. They build out sophisticated financial models and projections. But they may not have spoken to a single customer yet.

This would put their economic model at growth stage but their customer model at idea stage. And it would mean that the assumptions underpinning their economic model would almost certainly be wrong.

Likewise, if someone comes from a startup background, they might over-index on the customer model, leaving their impact model lagging behind. They push the venture forward with perhaps existential risks remaining in the impact model.

The opposite is often true for people coming in from the nonprofit space. They may massively over-index on the impact model, prioritizing huge investment in impact model development and measurement frameworks. But they have no idea whether their business model can create value for customers.

In all of these cases, the Venture Stage Map can stop you getting too far out ahead of your skis on any one part of your business model. It keeps your approach coherent and balanced.

It will also help you understand what parts of your business model need to be prioritized as you develop your strategy to take you forward.

### Introducing Our Example: Toast Ale

To make this concrete, we're going to follow an example throughout this module.

We'll use Toast Ale - a real purpose-driven brewery you can explore in the example library. Toast Ale makes award-winning craft beer from surplus bread, fighting food waste while funding environmental charities with their profits. They're a great example of how a venture can integrate a strong business model with meaningful impact.

`[MAIN PANEL: Toast Ale logo or simple visual]`

But here's what we're going to do: we're going to imagine Toast Ale at the very beginning of their journey. We're going to talk hypothetically about what the founders might have thought and done when they were first starting out at idea stage.

This is not their actual history. We're using Toast Ale as a teaching example because it's a clear, relatable concept that helps illustrate how strategy works.

Think of this as: "If we were building Toast Ale from scratch today, what might that journey look like?"

### Toast Ale at Idea Stage

So let's imagine the founders of Toast Ale at the very beginning.

They've just discovered that forty-four percent of bread is wasted globally. That's a massive amount of food going to landfill, contributing to climate change.

They have an idea: What if we made beer from surplus bread?

The concept is simple. Partner with bakeries to collect their unsold bread. Use it to replace some of the malted barley in the brewing process. Create a great-tasting craft beer. And fund environmental charities with the profits.

`[MAIN PANEL: Simple sketch/diagram of the concept - bread → beer → impact]`

This is our hypothetical starting point. A compelling concept, but completely untested.

Let's assess where the founders are using the Venture Stage Map.

### Stage Assessment

**Customer Model: Idea Stage**

The founders have assumptions about who will buy this beer. Probably craft beer drinkers who care about sustainability. But they haven't spoken to any customers yet. They don't know if people will buy "waste bread beer" or if there's stigma attached to that positioning. They don't know what people will pay, where they'll buy it, or what the unique value proposition needs to be.

The customer model is pure hypothesis.

**Impact Model: Idea Stage**

The founders have a hypothesis about the impact chain. Collect surplus bread, brew it into beer, reduce food waste, fund environmental causes with profits.

But they haven't tested any of this. Can they actually source enough surplus bread? Will bakeries partner with them? How much waste will actually be diverted? What environmental outcomes will the funded charities create?

The impact logic seems sound, but it's untested.

**Economic Model: Idea Stage**

The founders have back-of-napkin numbers. They think they can brew the beer for about the same cost as regular craft beer since bread replaces some expensive malted barley. They assume they can charge craft beer prices. They're guessing at distribution costs.

But these are all guesses. No real data on unit economics, breakeven points, or whether the channels will work.

**Organisation: Idea Stage**

The founders are working on this part-time while keeping their day jobs. Small team, no formal structure, no funding beyond personal savings.

### What This Tells Us

Looking at this stage assessment, everything is balanced - which is good for idea stage. The founders aren't over-developed in any dimension.

But it also tells us what needs to happen next. The biggest risks and uncertainties span all three models. They need to start validating the customer model first - because without customers who will buy the beer, nothing else matters.

But the impact model also has critical assumptions that need testing early. And the economic model assumptions will need validation as the venture progresses.

This stage assessment will guide the validation strategy we develop in the next sections.


### Assess Your Own Stage

Take a moment to assess where your own venture is on this map. Look across all four dimensions:

Your Customer Model - where are you? Idea stage, still discovering? Early stage, with some validation done? Further along?

Your Impact Model - how developed and tested is your theory of change?

Your Economic Model - how much do you actually know about your unit economics and growth potential?

Your Organisation - how structured and resourced are you?

`[VISUAL TEXT: assess each dimension | look for imbalance | identify what needs validation]`

Once you understand where you are, you can start planning where to go next.

In the next section, we'll look at what validation actually means and how to approach it.
