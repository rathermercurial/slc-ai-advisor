# The Improvement Process

Here's how to actually work through improving your economic model.

**First, as with the other models - gather input.** Talk with advisors, experts, and team members. Show them your canvas. Talk them through how your whole business model fits together, but focus in on your economic model. Gather feedback on where they think the weaknesses are and what improvements they'd suggest.

Use AI tools to explore possibilities. They can help you think broadly about different options that you can then narrow in on.

Also look in the canvas example library for ventures that are in a similar space to you and see how they found an economic model that works.

**Second, work through systematically.** Work through each canvas box in your Economic Model. Based on the ideas we've just talked through and feedback from advisors, brainstorm possible changes you could make.

`[MAIN PANEL: Economic Model section with boxes highlighted in sequence]`

**Third, test ripple effects.** For each idea you have that you think has potential, zoom out.

First, consider the rest of the economic model. How would these changes affect how the economic model functions as a system?

For example, if you swapped out a customer acquisition channel - say you switched from a direct sales channel where you're selling to big box stores and shifted to an online model - what effect would this have on your revenue and costs?

Would this change how much you could charge for your product? How would this change your cost model now that you don't have to support inventory at many stores or a team of salespeople, but you now need to fund online sales channels?

Then, if an idea is looking positive, zoom out to your business model as a whole. What implications would this change have on your impact model and your customer model? What would have to change across your whole business model?



Would this make your business model better as a whole?

**Fourth, document alternatives.** Once you've done this, make a list of ideas that you've generated. Prioritize the ones you want to explore further and flesh out a Social Lean Canvas that incorporates each new idea.

This gives you a stable place to work from as you develop your strategy.

### Readiness Check

You're ready to move on when you can confidently answer these questions:

Can you demonstrate positive unit economics, even if approximate?

Do you know what your breakeven point looks like

Do you understand the channels you will take to reach enough customers?

Can you identify at least one form of leverage in your model?

If yes, create a list of your core economic assumptions that you are making in your economic model. You'll need these when you start validating.

Here's how to actually work through
improving your economic model First, as

2
00:00:04,354 --> 00:00:08,735
with the other models, gather input, talk
with advisors, experts, and team members.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,549
Show them your canvas.

4
00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:13,549
Talk them through how your whole
business model fits together,

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,690
but focus on your economic model.

6
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,329
Gather feedback on where they
think the weaknesses are and what

7
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:20,979
improvements they would suggest.

8
00:00:21,424 --> 00:00:23,914
Use AI tools to explore possibilities.

9
00:00:24,056 --> 00:00:26,495
They can help you think
broadly about different options

10
00:00:26,495 --> 00:00:27,605
that you can narrow in on.

11
00:00:28,157 --> 00:00:32,117
Also, look in the canvas example library
for ventures that are in the similar

12
00:00:32,117 --> 00:00:36,137
space to you and see how they found a
way to make their economic model work.

13
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:41,573
Second, work through, systematically work
through each canvas box in your economic

14
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:45,759
model  based on the ideas we've just
talked through and feedback from advisors.

15
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:48,072
possible changes that you could make.

16
00:00:48,737 --> 00:00:52,673
Third test ripple effects For each
idea that you have that you think has

17
00:00:52,673 --> 00:00:56,564
potential, zoom out first, consider
the rest of your economic model.

18
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:00,485
How would these changes affect how the
economic model functions as a system?

19
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:05,042
For example, if you swapped out a
customer acquisition channel, say you

20
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:08,544
switched from a direct sales channel
where you're selling to big box

21
00:01:08,544 --> 00:01:10,554
stores and shifted to an online model.

22
00:01:10,874 --> 00:01:13,484
What effect would this have
on your revenue and costs?

23
00:01:13,758 --> 00:01:16,244
Would this change how much you
could charge for your product?

24
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,978
How would this change your cost model Now
that you don't have to support inventory

25
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:22,468
at many stores or a team of salespeople.

26
00:01:22,654 --> 00:01:24,931
But you need to fund
online sales channels.

27
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:29,454
Then if an idea is looking positive, zoom
out to your business model as a whole.

28
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:32,219
What implications would this
change have for your impact

29
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:33,254
model and your customer model?

30
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:36,021
What would have to change
across your whole business

31
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:37,521
model to make this successful?

32
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,808
Would this make your business
model better as a complete system?

33
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:43,115
Fourth, document alternatives.

34
00:01:43,368 --> 00:01:45,845
Once you've done this, make a list
of the ideas you've generated.

35
00:01:46,495 --> 00:01:50,254
Prioritize the ones you want to explore
further, and flesh out a social link

36
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:52,504
canvas that incorporates each new idea.

37
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:56,553
This gives you a stable place to work
from as you develop your strategy.

38
00:01:57,415 --> 00:01:58,465
You're ready to move on.

39
00:01:58,465 --> 00:02:01,898
When you can confidently answer
these questions, Can you demonstrate

40
00:02:01,898 --> 00:02:05,708
that positive unit economics are
possible, even if just approximate?

41
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,439
Do you know what your
breakeven point looks like?

42
00:02:08,806 --> 00:02:12,539
Do you understand what channels you'll
take to reach your target customers?

43
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:16,481
And can you identify at least one
form of leverage in your model?

44
00:02:17,197 --> 00:02:20,582
If you create a list of the core
economic assumptions that you're

45
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:24,013
making in your economic model, you'll
need these when you start validating.
