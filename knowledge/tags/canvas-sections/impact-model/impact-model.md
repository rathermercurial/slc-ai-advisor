# impact-model

## Definition
The `impact-model` tag identifies content about the Impact Model section of the Social Lean Canvas - how enterprises translate purpose into measurable social or environmental outcomes through a logical chain of causality.

## Usage Criteria
Apply this tag to content that:
- Explains the impact model framework and methodology
- Discusses the logic model or theory of change approach
- Provides guidance on developing impact chains
- Analyzes impact model effectiveness and measurement

## Always Include When
- Content covers the impact model as a complete framework
- Impact chain development methodologies
- Theory of change and logic model approaches
- Impact measurement and evaluation frameworks

## Never Include When
- Content focuses on only one specific component (use specific tag instead)
- General impact measurement content not tied to canvas framework
- Social impact content not using the canvas impact model structure

## Required Combinations
- Must include appropriate canvas-sections hierarchy: [impact-model]
- Often combined with specific sub-component tags when content spans multiple areas

## Content Examples
- Impact model methodology and framework
- Theory of change development guidance
- Impact chain logic and causality analysis
- Impact measurement frameworks

## Related Tags
- Sub-component tags: [issue](issue/issue.md), [participants](participants/participants.md), [activities](activities/activities.md), [outputs](outputs/outputs.md), [short-term-outcomes](short-term-outcomes/short-term-outcomes.md), [medium-term-outcomes](medium-term-outcomes/medium-term-outcomes.md), [long-term-outcomes](long-term-outcomes/long-term-outcomes.md), [impact](impact/impact.md)
- Often combined with `concept` content tags for theoretical content
- May appear with `experiment-test` content tags for impact validation approaches

## Sub-Components Structure
- [Issue](issue/issue.md) - Problem or opportunity being addressed
- [Participants](participants/participants.md) - Stakeholders involved in activities
- [Activities](activities/activities.md) - Actions taken to create change
- [Outputs](outputs/outputs.md) - Direct products of activities
- [Short-term Outcomes](short-term-outcomes/short-term-outcomes.md) - Initial changes (0-1 year)
- [Medium-term Outcomes](medium-term-outcomes/medium-term-outcomes.md) - Intermediate changes (1-3 years)
- [Long-term Outcomes](long-term-outcomes/long-term-outcomes.md) - Sustained changes (3+ years)
- [Impact](impact/impact.md) - Ultimate social/environmental change

## Key Concepts
- Chain of causality
- Attribution vs. contribution
- Timeframe distinctions
- Measurable outcomes vs. broad impact
