Here’s a concise breakdown of how **Linking Your Thinking (LYT)** runs its model so you can borrow the pieces that matter.

  

### **Positioning & promise**

- **Who it serves:** knowledge workers/creators who want a durable PKM system.
    
- **Promise:** “Build a custom system to support your best thinking” in a **30-day workshop** (recurring cohorts). 
    

  

### **Offer ladder (free → paid → alumni)**

- **Free lead magnets**
    
    - **LYT Kit (Obsidian vault template):** hands-on starter kit surfaced via the Obsidian Hub and LYT site. 
        
    - **Email course & YouTube channel:** ongoing audience growth. 
        
    
- **Core paid product**
    
    - **LYT Workshop:** **4-week / ~30-day cohort** with live sessions, exercises, and community. Materials include lifetime access. Next cohorts listed (e.g., **Oct 2025**). 
        
    
- **Extensions**
    
    - **Self-paced courses with “synced sprints”** (e.g., _Notemaking Mastery_, _Writing Original Works_). 
        
    - **Alumni/Journey packages:** some members **return for multiple cohorts** in a year (social accountability, updated concepts). 
        
    

  

### **Delivery mechanics**

- **Live, interactive sessions** (Nick + team) during the cohort; community hosted on **Circle**. 
    
- **Signature method** around **Maps of Content (MOCs)** and linked-note practices, documented publicly. 
    
- **Cadence & social proof:** named cohorts (LYT 11, 14, 16, etc.) with participant write-ups. 
    

  

### **Monetization & pricing signals**

- **Cohort tuition** (historically **low four figures** per community posts; pricing varies by cohort). 
    
- **Upsells:** repeat cohorts (Journey), self-paced courses, and related trainings (e.g., Obsidian Flight School). 
    

  

### **Ops & stack (replicable)**

- **Acquisition:** YouTube → free kit → waitlist. 
    
- **Delivery:** Zoom/stream + Circle; templates & vaults (Obsidian). 
    
- **IP assets:** curriculum, exercises, vault templates, and public MOC docs. 
    

  

### **Purpose / impact angle**

- Framed as **humane productivity & creative clarity**—“reclaim your thoughts” rather than hustle. Taught at institutions; aims to reduce overwhelm through better thinking systems. 
    

  

### **Evidence of durability**

- Regular, numbered cohorts (e.g., **LYT 16 in Oct 2025**), alumni returning, and ongoing public discourse/reviews. 
    

  

### **Quick take for the typology**

- **Archetype fit:** _PKM & Thinking Systems Coaching_ (Consulting & Coaching).
    
- **Solo fit:** One instructor + a few assistants can run seasonal cohorts and maintain evergreen assets.
    
- **Transferable playbook:** free kit → cohort workshop → alumni community → self-paced add-ons; publish signature concepts (MOCs) openly to build legitimacy.
