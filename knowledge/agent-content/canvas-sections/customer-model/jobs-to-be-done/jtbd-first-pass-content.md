### Jobs to be Done

Filling in the jobs to be done section of the canvas is about understanding what's motivating your customers, what will drive them to engage with your solution, what job is your customer going to hire your product or service to do for them.

Make sure that you go deeper here than just the obvious need that the customer has. Dig deep to find the particular thing that you will be able to do for them that isn't currently available to them from someone else.

Identify at least one key job to be done for each of your customer types and then color code or number each of them so that you can see what customer type they relate to. Clearly identifying and understanding the jobs that your customers need done is really important. It's the basis for how your business model will create value for them.

### Existing Alternatives

Existing alternatives show how your future customers are currently getting these jobs done. And this is important for two main reasons. Firstly, it shows evidence of customer need. If your potential customers are already engaging with an existing alternative, it shows that the customer actually does want this job to be done in real life.

Secondly, it starts to outline who your competitors might be, showing you who is already out there doing these jobs for your customer.

You might also find that you're competing against an existing alternative of just doing nothing. This is important to identify early because if your future customers are not currently trying to get these jobs done, then it could mean that they don't really care about getting them done after all.
