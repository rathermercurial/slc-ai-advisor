## **Origin story (3–5 lines)**

- Founded by [**Anne-Laure Le Cunff**](https://anne-laure.net/), ex-Google, who started [**Ness Labs**](https://nesslabs.com/) as a way to learn and share neuroscience-backed tools for mindful productivity while studying at King’s College London. 
    
- Early posts/newsletters in **2019** evolved into the **Maker Mind** weekly, building a community around “don’t work more, work mindfully.” ([2019 review](https://nesslabs.com/annual-review-2019) • [site tagline](https://nesslabs.com/)) 
    
- Today it’s a learning community with courses, articles, and a newsletter serving **100,000+ subscribers**. ([Newsletter page](https://nesslabs.com/newsletter-curiosity-consistency) • [Get featured](https://nesslabs.com/get-featured)) 
    
- Anne-Laure is also a neuroscientist and the author of [**Tiny Experiments**](https://nesslabs.com/book).

## **Why it’s relevant to SLC (solo-preneur with purpose)**

- **Highly replicable** solo/tiny-team model: newsletter → courses → community → book/speaking, with modest ops and recurring revenue. ([Membership](https://nesslabs.com/membership) • [Book](https://nesslabs.com/book))
