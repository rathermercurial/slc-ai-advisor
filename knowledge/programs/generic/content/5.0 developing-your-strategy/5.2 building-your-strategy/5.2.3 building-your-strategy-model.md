### Key Metrics: Tracking Your Progress

<span style="color:red">clap</span> 

Now let's talk about how you track progress through your strategy.

`[MAIN PANEL: Key Metrics box on canvas]`

Your key metrics correspond to what you're validating at each stage. They show whether your experiments are succeeding, whether you're learning what you need to learn, and whether you're moving forward.

### What to Track When

Early stage validation metrics are different from later stage execution metrics.

**0-2 Months: Discovery Phase**

In the discovery phase, Toast Ale tracks activity metrics. Did they complete twenty-five customer interviews? Did they engage ten bakeries in conversations? Did they run five taste test sessions? Are they documenting the key insights they're learning?

These metrics show whether they're doing the discovery work they planned. Are they generating the insights they need to move forward?

**2-6 Months: Proof Phase**

In the proof phase, the metrics shift to validation. What's the shelf-to-purchase conversion rate? They're targeting fifteen percent. What's their customer acquisition cost through bottle shops? They want it under three dollars per customer. How much bread are they collecting from bakeries? They're targeting five hundred kilograms over three months. What emissions are they avoiding based on the bread they've diverted?

These metrics prove whether their assumptions hold up at scale. They're not tracking activities anymore - they're tracking whether the model works.

**6-18 Months: Scale Phase**

In the scale phase, metrics become more about execution. What's their monthly production volume and revenue? What's their gross margin per bottle - they need forty percent or better to make the economics work. What's the customer retention rate - are thirty percent of customers repurchasing within three months? What's their cumulative environmental impact - total bread diverted, total emissions avoided?

These are business performance metrics now. They're measuring whether the business model is working at scale.

Your metrics evolve as you progress through your strategy. Each phase needs different measurements because you're answering different questions.

### Ratios vs Hard Numbers

Use ratios, not just hard numbers, because ratios give you scalable insights.

**Hard number:** "We sold 500 bottles" - Okay, but what does that mean?

**Ratio:** "15% shelf-to-purchase conversion rate" - Now you can predict what happens when you're in 50 shops instead of 10.

**Hard number:** "We got 25 referrals" - Is that good?

**Ratio:** "10% referral rate from paying customers" - Now you know: for every 100 customers, you get 10 referrals. That's predictive power.

Toast Ale might use ratios throughout:

- Conversion rate (activation to purchase)
- Customer acquisition cost (dollars per customer)
- Retention rate (percentage who repurchase)
- Bread diversion efficiency (kg collected per bakery per week)

These ratios let them model what happens at scale.

### Avoiding Vanity Metrics

Vanity metrics feel good but don't show learning. They make you feel like you're making progress when you might not be.

**Vanity:** "Total bottles sold" - Could be driven by you buying your own product or friends pity-buying.

**Real:** "Conversion rate from retail shelf to purchase" - Shows actual customer demand.

**Vanity:** "Total social media followers" - Means nothing if they don't buy.

**Real:** "Customer acquisition cost through social media" - Shows if social media is an effective channel.

**Vanity:** "Total bread collected" - Sounds impressive but doesn't show efficiency.

**Real:** "Cost per kilogram of bread diverted" - Shows if the impact model economics work.

`[VISUAL TEXT: vanity = feels good | real = proves assumptions]`

Choose metrics that prove or disprove your assumptions. That's what moves you forward.

### Your Strategy Model as a Living Document

Your strategy model is not something you create once and never touch again. It's a living document that evolves as you learn.

Set regular review cycles. Maybe monthly in your early stages when things are changing fast. Quarterly once you're in execution mode.

In each review, ask:

What did we learn from our validation experiments?

What assumptions were proven? What were disproven?

Does our strategy need to change based on what we learned?

`[MAIN PANEL: Strategy review cycle diagram]`

When validation invalidates assumptions - and it will - revise your strategy.

For Toast Ale, imagine after two months of customer discovery they learned that bottle shops aren't actually the right channel. Craft beer drinkers who care about sustainability shop mostly online and at farmers markets.

This invalidates their 2-6 month plan. The bottle shop pilot won't work.

So they revise: Instead of bottle shops, they plan an online sales pilot and farmers market presence. This changes their organizational layer (need e-commerce capability, not retail relationships). Might change their capital layer (different infrastructure costs).

`[VISUAL TEXT: learn → revise → execute → learn]`

The strategy model makes this revision process clean. You can see the ripple effects across all three layers and adjust accordingly.

This is how you navigate uncertainty. Not by predicting perfectly, but by planning flexibly and revising as you learn.

### Stage-Appropriate Strategy

Your strategy will look different depending on what stage you're at.

`[MAIN PANEL: Venture Stage Map reference]`

**Idea Stage** - Mostly experiments, minimal organizational structure, usually bootstrapped. Your strategy is primarily about discovery .

**Early Stage** - Mix of validation and execution, building organizational capacity, possibly first external capital. Your strategy balances proving and building.

**Growth Stage** - Validating that the model will work at scale, raising capital for growth if needed. Your strategy focuses on growing into a business that can succeed

**Scale Stage** - Optimizing and improving, investing in scale, professional management. Strategic partnerships. Your strategy focuses on sustained delivery of your economics and impact at scale

Toast Ale starts at idea stage across all dimensions. Their strategy reflects this - discovery-heavy early on, building toward early stage through validation.

Your strategy should match your stage. Don't try to build growth stage infrastructure when you're at idea stage. And don't stay in perpetual validation mode when you're ready to execute.

### Creating Your Strategy Model: A Working Session

This is substantial work. Don't rush it.

Set aside dedicated time - maybe a weekend - to work through this properly. If you have a team, do it together. If you have advisors, involve them in reviewing your thinking.

But remember: You hold the systems view. Advisors see through the lens of their expertise. You see how all the pieces fit together.

Use advisors for input and challenge. Don't outsource your thinking to them. This is your strategy. You need to own it.

`[VISUAL TEXT: dedicated time | involve team/advisors | you hold systems view]`


By the end, have a clear two-month plan, a solid six-month plan, and a directional eighteen-month plan. All three layers mapped and integrated.

When you have this, you are ready to execute
### Ready to Move Forward

You have a complete strategy model when you can answer these questions:

Do you have a clear, detailed two-month plan?

Have you mapped a logical six-month plan based on your validation experiments succeeding?

Do you have an aspirational eighteen-month plan showing your longer arc?

Have you built all three layers - business model, organizational, and capital?

Do the layers work together, with each enabling the others?

Have you identified your key metrics for tracking progress at each stage?

`[VISUAL TEXT: 2/6/18 plans clear | three layers integrated | metrics defined]`

If yes, you have a strategy. You know what you're doing next and why. You have a roadmap from where you are now to where you're heading.

Time to wrap this up and start to execute the strategy.
