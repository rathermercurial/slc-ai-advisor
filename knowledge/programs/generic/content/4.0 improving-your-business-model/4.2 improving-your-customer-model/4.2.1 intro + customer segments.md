Let's start with your Customer Model.

`[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas - highlight Customer Model section]`

### Quick Diagnostic Check

Before we dive in, ask yourself these questions about your customer model:

Can you clearly articulate who will definitely pay for your solution?

Are your customer segments big enough sustain the business model?

Is your product or service the right thing to deliver what your customer actually needs?

Are your early adopters signaling a bigger market?

`[VISUAL TEXT: clear customers? | big enough market? | right solution? | early adopters signal growth?]`

If you're hesitating on any of these, you've got work to do. Red flags include vague customer definitions, thinking "everyone could use this," having no clear beachhead segment that will get you to success, or a solution that is looking for a problem to solve, or a customer that doesn't have a real need.

### Customer Model Fundamentals - Quick Refresh

Your customer model maps how your create value for customers in a way that your economic model can deliver and capture enough of that value to make your business model work. Let's refresh the key concepts.

`[MAIN PANEL: Customer Model section on canvas]`

**Customer Types** are the distinct roles people play in your value creation process - it could be a user, payer, sponsor, volunteer

**Customer Segments** are the characteristics within each type. Who specifically are these people? What makes them distinct? What makes THEM more likely to be your customer than just any old person?


### Beachhead Customers

We call your early target customers your **beachhead customer segment**.

This is the core, tightly-defined customer segment that can get your venture to success on its own. Not your broadest possible market. Not everyone who might eventually buy from you. The focused segment you can win first.

`[VISUAL TEXT: beachhead = focused | winnable | big enough]`

Your beachhead segment needs to be large enough to reach business model success, but narrow enough that you can intimately understand and speak to it.

### Early Adopters Within Your Beachhead

Within your beachhead segment, you'll find an even smaller group: your **early adopters**.

These customers have the same job to be done as your broader beachhead segment, but in an amplified way. They desperately need what you're building. They'll talk about your solution before you've even made it. They're already trying to solve this problem themselves.

Here's an example. Say you're making a supplement that helps people fall back to sleep when they wake up in the night.

Your broader one-day market might be people who want to sleep better... probably half the world's population. 

You beachhead segment might be sleep-deprived professional adults in developed countries - perhaps you estimate that there are about one million people this market who would pay enough for you solution to make it viable.

In this case, your early adopters might -  Parents with professional jobs who have just had their first baby. Maybe there are only 10,000 of these in your market, but these people with a new, painful problem to solve. The same problem that the broader market has but more acutely. They're likely already looking for and trying solutions. They'll bite your arm off if you tell them you have something that will work for them. They'll help you understand the problem and how to solve it. 

`[VISUAL TEXT: 5M sleep-deprived adults | 50K parents with newborns]`

These parents might not be a big enough segment to be your main market. Especially if your product costs a lot of money to develop and have approved. But they signal the larger beachhead. Same core need - just amplified.

`[MAIN PANEL: Technology adoption lifecycle diagram]`


### The technology adoption lifecycle 

The technology adoption lifecycle shows how this works. Your early adopters lead into your early majority - the main body of your beachhead segment. These are customers who need the product to be complete and good, but will jump in as soon as it is. When they adopt, you've reached product-market fit within your beachhead.

Then the late majority follows when it's safe. And laggards when it's embarrassing not to.

**The critical point:** Your early adopters must signal your larger beachhead market. Same needs, just less pronounced. You don't want to discover later that your early adopters are just a tiny isolated market and your real beachhead is somewhere else entirely.

Make sure the flow - customer segment, job to be done, unique value proposition, solution - is the same for your early adopters as it is for your broader beachhead segment.

### The Goal: Product-Market Fit

When you fully understand each customer's job to be done, craft a compelling unique value proposition they can't resist, and deliver that UVP with a solution that perfectly hits the mark - that's product-market fit.
