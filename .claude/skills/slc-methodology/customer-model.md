# Customer Model

The Customer Model defines who you serve and how you create value for them. It contains 4 interconnected sections.

## Sections

### 1. Customers

**Question:** Who are you serving?

**Key distinctions:**
- **Customer types** (broad categories) vs **Customer segments** (specific groups)
- Consider both **beneficiaries** (who receives impact) and **payers** (who pays)
- Social ventures often have multiple customer types

**Example (Facebook):**
- Types: Users, Advertisers, Developers
- Segments under Users: Students, Professionals, Creators

### 2. Jobs To Be Done

**Question:** What problems do they need solved?

**Framework:** Focus on the **job** the customer is trying to accomplish, not features.

**Categories:**
- **Functional jobs**: Practical tasks (e.g., "share photos with family")
- **Social jobs**: Status/identity needs (e.g., "look successful to peers")
- **Emotional jobs**: Feelings (e.g., "feel connected to community")

**Tip:** Use "When _____, I want to _____, so I can _____" format.

### 3. Value Proposition

**Question:** How do you uniquely solve their problems?

**NOT the same as Solution** - Value Proposition is the *benefit*, Solution is the *how*.

**Components:**
- Gain creators (what benefits you provide)
- Pain relievers (what problems you eliminate)
- Unique differentiators (why you, not competitors)

**Test:** Can you complete "We help [customer] [achieve outcome] by [unique approach]"?

### 4. Solution

**Question:** What is your product/service?

**Describe:**
- Core offering (product, service, platform)
- Key features (minimum viable)
- Delivery mechanism

**Keep it simple:** Focus on what exists or will exist in MVP, not future vision.

## Relationships

```
Customers ──→ have ──→ Jobs To Be Done
                          ↓
                    addressed by
                          ↓
                  Value Proposition ──→ delivered via ──→ Solution
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Confusing beneficiaries with customers** - In social ventures, the person paying may not be the person benefiting
2. **Features instead of jobs** - "We provide an app" vs "We help parents track child development"
3. **Value prop = solution** - Keep them separate; value is the benefit, solution is the mechanism
4. **Too many customer segments** - Focus on 1-3 primary segments for MVP
