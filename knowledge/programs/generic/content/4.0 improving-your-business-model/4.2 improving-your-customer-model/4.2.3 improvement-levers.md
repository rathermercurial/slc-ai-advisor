# Strategic Improvement Levers

These are organized by what aspect of the customer model you're changing: WHO you're serving, WHO PAYS for it, or WHAT VALUE you're delivering.

### WHO - Market and Segment Scope

First, the beachhead strategy.

Remember the three circles model? You're looking for the core customer segment that you can serve to get the venture to success. Don't just list anyone who might buy your product.

Narrow in on a niche of people who will absolutely buy your product, for a good price, and that's big enough to get you to success. You can expand out into adjacent customer segments when you're already succeeding.

If your early adopters represent a large enough TAM to get you to success, focus on them as your beachhead customer segment. But if they're not going to be enough, you'll have to broaden your beachhead TAM to include members of your early majority.


Now, three ways to adjust your market and segment scope:

**Broaden.** If your customer segment is too small, can you broaden to include a larger segment with the same compelling proposition?

**Narrow.** Is your customer segment specific enough? Don't be afraid to narrow in on a very niche customer segment that has a stronger and easier to articulate version of the problem you're going to solve.

**Look to adjacent segments.** Could a nearby segment have a stronger job to be done, fewer alternatives, or more ability to pay?

### WHO PAYS - User, Buyer, Funder

Second strategic lever: who's actually paying?

**Follow the money.** Don't be afraid to give up on a customer segment that wants your product, in favor of one that will pay more - assuming this doesn't invalidate your impact model, of course.

You're better off having a smaller market of highly motivated customers who will pay more. This is especially true at the beginning.

Your early adopters don't just want your product - they NEED your product. Make sure you aren't just selling an okay thing to a vanilla market. Sell an amazing thing to a well-defined market. That's product-market fit.

**Rethink your customer types**If your model has multiple customer types, can they be reworked and recombined in a more powerful way?

Perhaps the user can't pay enough to sustain the model, but someone else will pay. With a social enterprise, the user may benefit but not pay much. But there could be a government buyer of outcomes who will pay. Or a sponsor who'd love to be associated with the work and would subsidize the user.

Or perhaps there could be two user types: a standard user who pays a discounted price and a premium user who funds the standard users' access to the product or service.

### WHAT VALUE - Job and Value Framing

Third strategic lever: how you're framing the value.

**Category reframing.** Think through the job to be done. Is this the highest value job for this customer?

If you go deeper into the psychology of the customer, you might discover there's a deeper need underneath the need you think you're serving. Luxury brands know this well. They're not serving a functional need - they're serving a status need.

Understanding that your product can serve deep psychological needs for your customers can completely reframe your value proposition, the value the customer perceives, and what they'll pay for it.

You could **Find an acute need.** Is there another customer segment that you could do a much higher value job with the same solution? One person's nice-to-have could be another's must-have.

For example, a few years ago a law was passed in my home country or Aotearoa/New Zealand that made directors of companies criminally liable for workplace safety failures. If someone dies at the workplace, a company director could go to jail for it.

If you were a venture selling safety audits globally, you could pivot into the New Zealand market and find a whole market of customers with an urgent new must-have need.

You could try **Workflow repositioning.** Move upstream or downstream to find a place to play where your value is clearer.

For example, rather than offering advisory services for buildings to assess accessibility for people with disabilities, you move upstream and sell design audits in partnership with architects.

Rather than being the organization that points out how bad things are, this positions you where the value you contribute can be integrated into building designs. The builder gets credit for partnering with a disabilities organization. This allows you to charge more AND your recommendations will actually lead to better accessibility outcomes.

You can work on **Solution improvement.** Improving the value your solution delivers is one of the key levers of your business model. If the rest of your customer model is correct, your solution is how the value you promise gets delivered.

If you can find meaningful improvements, you can improve ARPU by increasing the price you can charge. Or improve ARPU by decreasing the churn rate - the rate at which customers stop using and paying for your product or service. Or create cost reductions through making delivery of your business model more efficient.

It's important to recognize that getting people to switch from their existing alternative to your product requires your solution to be significantly better than their current solution. So if what you currently have in your solution box is not either significantly better or significantly cheaper than the existing alternatives, then you should invest time to improve it.
