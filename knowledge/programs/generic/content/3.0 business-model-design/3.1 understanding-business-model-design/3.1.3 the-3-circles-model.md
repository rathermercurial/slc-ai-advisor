### The 3 Circles Model - Simplify to Succeed

As a founder, one of your key jobs is to decide what to prioritize and how MUCH you try to do right from the start?

There's a natural temptation to make your business model look impressive. Multiple customer segments. Different product offerings. Various revenue streams. More equals better, right? 

`[VISUAL TEXT: More complexity = More time + More risk]`

But there's a trap here: the more complex your business model is at the start, the more time and resources it will take to validate it. Complexity adds risk.

What makes a business model look good on paper often makes it impossible to validate in practice. You end up testing everything at once, getting conflicting signals from different customers wanting different things, and burning through your time and money.

For purpose-driven ventures, this is especially dangerous. You're already juggling both a customer model and an impact model. Adding unnecessary complexity on top of this is a recipe for failure.

You need a way to simplify and to focus on what actually matters for success.

### The Three Circles

The 3 Circles Model helps you strip away everything that doesn't need to be there right now.

`[MAIN PANEL: 3 circles diagram - Success (center), MVP (inner ring), Fantasy (outer)]`

It consists of, you guessed it, three circles: Success, MVP, and Fantasy.

The **Success circle** in the middle represents your core idea. The thing you think can work - that is, it can deliver your impact and your financial goals. This is what NEEDS to be true for your venture to succeed.

The **MVP circle** - which stands for Minimum Viable Product - is where you include your experiments and early versions of your product or service that will prove your Success model is viable. These are the tests that validate your core assumptions.

The **Fantasy circle** is for everything else. All those "nice to haves." Things that would be great to do but you don't NEED them for your to get to success. These ideas live here, and you'll revisit them once you've made your core model work. But you won't burn time, money, and effort validating them in the early stages.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Success = must work | MVP = prove it | Fantasy = later]`

Here's the key principle: only what's in your Success circle needs to be in your Social Lean Canvas right now. Everything else is distraction.

When you're validating, you're testing whether your Success circle works. Once it's working, you can expand. But not before.

### Facebook: A Case Study

Let's look at Facebook, they are not a purpose driven venture but how they developed in the early days makes them a good business model study.  

At the start, their Success circle was simple: become the largest social network on global university campuses. That's it. Not the everyone. Just university students.

Their MVP circle was even more focused: Harvard University first and then a few other American universities. This was to prove that for university students, their business model was right and could get to success.

In their Fantasy circle you could put all the things they would eventually achieve. All the customer segments beyond students. Becoming an identity platform. A gaming platform. Launching digital currency. Building AI. All of that.

If they had added all of these to their Success circle, they never would have been able to build an MVP to test them. They would have burned up all their time and money getting conflicting signals from different customers wanting different things. And they would have failed.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Students first | Campus by campus | Everything else waited]`

Instead, they focused. Students. Campuses. One at a time. To prove it worked. Then they expand into what they are today.

That's how Facebook became Facebook. Not by doing everything at once, but by doing one thing well, validating it, then expanding.

### Apply This to Your Venture

Now apply this to your venture.

Look at your current business model ideas. Ask yourself three questions:

What's genuinely needed for success? What has to work for your venture to deliver impact and achieve financial sustainability? That goes in your Success circle.

What experiments will prove your Success circle works? That's your MVP circle.

Everything that can wait until after you've validated your core model? This goes in your Fantasy circle.

`[VISUAL TEXT: What must work? | What proves it? | What can wait?]`

Be honest with yourself. Most things can wait. That extra customer segment you think would be nice to serve? Fantasy circle. That additional feature that sounds cool? Fantasy circle. That secondary revenue stream? Unless you need it for your core success model to be viable, Fantasy circle.

When you're filling in your Social Lean Canvas, focus only on the components that live in your Success circle. Your MVP experiments become your validation strategy - we'll cover that in the Strategy module.

You don't need to fill out the 3 circles model, it is a thinking tool. It will help you decide what goes in your canvas and what experiments you will run in your validation strategy. 

But do make a list of your Fantasy ideas somewhere. Keep them safe. You'll come back to them. But don't let them distract you from validating what actually matters.

Remember: for purpose-driven ventures, you already have the complexity of integrating an impact model with a customer model and an economic model. Don't make it harder by adding unnecessary pieces.

Simplify. Focus. Validate your core. And then expand.
