## P2P FRAMING

<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
Next you are going to work through the Core content on the Customer Model. This is where you map out how you create value for customers—the foundation of your business model.

The Core Framework walks through four key sections: Customers, Jobs to be Done, Unique Value Proposition, and Solution. You'll see how these pieces fit together as a coherent system.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Customers | JTBD | UVP | Solution]**

The Core content uses the term "social enterprise" broadly—this includes P2P ventures like yours. 

After you've gone through the framework core, we'll come back and talk about what matters most for P2P ventures specifically

**Tag line:** **Value creation starts here.**

## P2P COMMENTARY



<span style="color:green"> p2p 3.2.2 customer-model 2.webm.02.mp4.webm</span> 


**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Customer Model for PPVs"]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just walked you through the Customer Model—how to identify customers, understand their jobs to be done, craft unique value propositions, and design solutions. Now let's talk about this with a P2P flavor 

**Tag line:** **PPV customer strategy.**

### Mindset: 1,000 True Fans

**[MAIN PANEL: Visual showing small KK and 1000 true fans]**

First, a mindset shift. Small can be better, 

Kevin Kelly's concept of "1,000 True Fans" gives us a useful lens here.

You don't need millions of customers to build a viable venture. You need a minimum viable audience—people willing to directly support what you're building through subscriptions, purchases, memberships, whatever fits your model.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Small audience | Direct support | Viable business]**

For Purpose Pivot Ventures, this is strategic. Going narrow and deep with a niche group who really values what you offer can be more powerful than trying to serve a broad market. Especially when you're solo or small team.

**Tag line:** **Small and viable.**

### Building a Machine

**[MAIN PANEL: Flow diagram - Customers → JTBD → UVP → Solution]**

Remember, you're building a machine. Not just selling your time. Not just being labor.

For your machine to be scalable and repeatable, it needs a reliable way to create value. Your customer model does this by stringing together:

- Identifiable customers
- Jobs they need done
- Value propositions they'll engage with
- Solutions that deliver

**[VISUAL TEXT: System, not services | Repeatable value creation]**

All four pieces need to work together elegantly. If one piece is weak, the whole model struggles.

**Tag line:** **Build the system.**

### Beware Complexity: Customer Types Matter

**[MAIN PANEL: Simple model vs. complex multi-customer-type model]**

Be particularly aware of complexity in your customer model. The more complex your model the more difficult and expensive it will be to validate. 

 More customer types means multiplied work. Each customer type has its own jobs to be done, its own value proposition. You have to validate each one separately. More complexity, more validation work, more risk of getting things wrong.

**[VISUAL TEXT: More types = More JTBD | More UVPs | More validation | More risk]**

Let's look at two examples from the library to understand this better. 

**[MAIN PANEL: Plausible Analytics canvas - Customer section]**

Plausible Analytics keeps it simple. Single customer type—privacy-conscious developers who need web analytics.

Their flow: Developers frustrated with Google Analytics (customer) need privacy-respecting analytics (JTBD) that doesn't compromise on features (UVP) delivered through a lightweight, open-source tool (solution).

Clean. One customer type, one clear flow. Solo-founder viable.

**[MAIN PANEL: Ridwell canvas - Customer section]**

Ridwell is more complex. They have 2 customer types—households who want to recycle hard-to-recycle items, and city/waste partners who need better recycling solutions.

Each type has different jobs, different value propositions. The household customer wants convenience and environmental impact. The city partner wants cost reduction and sustainability metrics. Two distinct flows that have to work together.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Ridwell | 2 customer types | 2x validation work | Higher complexity]**

Does Ridwell need this complexity? Probably. Their model requires it. So they will have gone  eyes open knowing they'd have to validate and serve two different customer type.

If you're adding a second (or more) customer type, ask hard questions about whether you really need it. Sometimes you do. Just understand you're signing up for multiplied work and risk.

**Tag line:** **Simple beats complex.**

### P2P Constraints on Segment Selection

**[MAIN PANEL: Channel types - content/SEO/community vs. high-touch sales]**

When you're choosing customer segments, as a solo or small venture you will probably face some constraints.

Channel constraints. A solo founder will find it hard to do high-touch enterprise sales calls, you won't be able to afford a sales team. You need customers who can find you through content, SEO, community or word of mouth. Channels you can automate or scale without you needing to be everywhere at once.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Content-driven | SEO | Community | Not high-touch sales]**

Choose customers who value small. Some segments actively prefer solo or small teams—they get faster response times, more specialized expertise, a personal touch. Others want the appearance of a big company. Pick segments that work with what you are.

Look for async communication opportunities. You can't be available 24/7. Customers who expect instant support or constant hand-holding are tough to serve solo. Choose segments and usecases where asynchronous communication will be accepted

**[VISUAL TEXT: Value small | Async-friendly | Match your constraints]**

**Tag line:** **Choose compatible segments.**

### Purpose as UVP Amplifier

**[MAIN PANEL: Buy Me Once and Plausible Analytics UVP sections]**

Not all P2P Ventures will have well-developed purpose narratives. You might be doing this for yourself and your family—that story might not strengthen your business model beyond improving your own motivation.

But if your purpose can play a role in the attractiveness of your solution, the Customer Model is where it shows up.

For our Buy Me Once example— the desire for sustainable products is the core engine of value creation for customers and delivers the impact model for the venture. Purpose is integral to the value proposition that drives customers to engage. 

For Plausible Analytics—their mission to solve surveillance capitalism problems folds directly into their value proposition: "Privacy without Sacrifice" and "Transparency Through Open Source."

**[VISUAL TEXT: Purpose → UVP (when it fits)]**

If your authentic voice and commitment to purpose can strengthen your value proposition, lean into it. If not, that's fine too.

**Tag line:** **Purpose when relevant.**

### AI Enables Solo Operation

**[MAIN PANEL: Icons showing AI tools supporting different functions]**

Modern AI and digital tools make solo customer models viable in ways they weren't five years ago.

Content creation, customer research, marketing, logistics—you can leverage tools to do work that used to require teams. We'll dive deeper into specific tools and approaches in module 2 where we'll work on improving your business model.

For now, just know that being solo doesn't mean doing everything manually.

**[VISUAL TEXT: AI augments | Details in Section 4]**

**Tag line:** **AI enables scale.**

### Practical Guidance

**[MAIN PANEL: Customer Model sections on canvas]**

Keep it simple on your first pass. Get the basics down—customers, jobs, value propositions, solution.

If you're adding multiple customer types, pause and ask if you really need them. The complexity might be necessary, but go in eyes open.

Check out the P2P Example Library to see how different ventures mapped their customer models. The Core Example Library has additional examples showing various approaches.
