## INTRODUCTION

**Script (spoken):**

<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
Now you've mapped out your business model in the Social Lean Canvas. You need to answer a critical question: is it actually good enough to work on?

People spend years struggling away on business models that weren't never good enough to execute on. 
Better to find this out early and fix it before you spend time, money and effort on it.

**Tag line:** **Good enough to test?**

### What Makes It Good Enough?

**[MAIN PANEL: Business model design framework diagram from section 3.1]**

Back in Understanding Business Model Design, we outlined what a good business model looks like.

Your **Customer Model** has to have the potential to reach product-market fit. Clear customers with real jobs to be done. Value propositions they can't resist. Solutions that deliver.

Your **Impact Model** needs to deliver impact - both micro and macro. Short-term measurable outcomes. Long-term systemic change.

Your **Economic Model** needs to show positive unit economics and the potential for growth. Revenue exceeds costs. Path to sustainability.

**[VISUAL TEXT: product-market fit | impact delivery | positive unit economics + growth]**

You're not building a unicorn. You're building something sustainable at your scale. But the fundamentals still apply.

**Tag line:** **Three models work together.**

### What This Module Covers

**[MAIN PANEL: Return to full Social Lean Canvas with Customer, Impact, Economic sections highlighted in sequence]**

In this module, we'll walk through how to analyze each of these three models. We'll assess whether they're strong enough. And if not, we'll work through how to improve them.

We'll tackle the Customer Model first. Then the Impact Model. Then the Economic Model.

For each one, we'll continue this back and forth with the core social lean canvas content, you'll see the Core Framework on how to assess and improve, then we'll come back and talk about what this means for P2P ventures like yours.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Customer → Impact → Economic]**

You'll constantly learn, iterate, and improve your business model as you go. But you need to start from a solid foundation. This section is about building that solid starting foundation. 

**Tag line:** **Build on solid ground.**

---

### The Machine You're Building

**[MAIN PANEL: Simple system diagram showing Customer Model → Impact Model → Economic Model flowing together]**

Quick reminder. You're building a machine. A system that creates value for customers, delivers meaningful impact, and generates sustainable economics.

All three models need to work together. They're not separate - they're interconnected.

A strong customer model affects your economics. Efficient impact activities reduce costs. Better economics let you serve more customers and deliver more impact.

This systematic improvement work - right now - is how you make sure the machine you're building will actually work.

**[VISUAL TEXT: System, not pieces | All connected]**

**Tag line:** **Build the machine right.**

### Let's Begin

**[MAIN PANEL: Transition to Customer Model section]**

Time to get systematic. We'll start with your Customer Model.

Let's see if it's strong enough to get you to product-market fit - and if not, how to make it better.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,745
Now that you've mapped out your business
model in the social and canvas, you

2
00:00:03,745 --> 00:00:05,815
need to answer a critical question.

3
00:00:06,147 --> 00:00:08,127
Is it actually good enough to work on?

4
00:00:08,827 --> 00:00:12,817
People spend years struggling away on
business models that were never good

5
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:14,857
enough to execute on in the first place.

6
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:18,832
Better to find this out early
and fix it before you spend time,

7
00:00:18,832 --> 00:00:20,572
money, and effort working on it.

8
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:25,141
Back in understanding business
model design, we outlined what a

9
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:26,396
good business model looks like.

10
00:00:26,962 --> 00:00:30,892
Your customer model has to have the
potential to reach product market

11
00:00:30,892 --> 00:00:35,457
fit, clear customers with real jobs
to be done, value propositions.

12
00:00:35,457 --> 00:00:36,357
They can't resist.

13
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:40,572
Solutions that deliver your
impact model needs to deliver,

14
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:43,031
impact both macro and micro.

15
00:00:43,203 --> 00:00:47,103
Short-term measurable outcomes,
long-term systemic change.

16
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:52,734
Your economic model needs to positive unit
economics and the potential for growth.

17
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:56,221
Revenue exceeds costs, and
a path to sustainability.

18
00:00:56,877 --> 00:01:00,957
Even though you're not building a unicorn,
you're building something sustainable

19
00:01:00,957 --> 00:01:03,687
at your scale, the fundamentals still.

20
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:09,862
In this module, we'll walk through how
to analyze each of these three models.

21
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:14,152
We'll assess whether they're
strong enough and if not, we'll

22
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:15,862
work on how to improve them.

23
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:19,655
We'll tackle the customer model
first, then the impact model,

24
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:20,825
and then the economic model.

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,416
For each one.

26
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,911
We'll continue this back and forth with
the core social Lean Canvas content.

27
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:31,566
You'll see the core framework on how to
assess and improve your business model.

28
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:35,154
Then we'll come back and talk
about what this means for P

29
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:36,594
two P ventures like yours.

30
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,238
You'll consistently learn, iterate, and
improve your business model as you go, but

31
00:01:42,238 --> 00:01:44,583
you need to start from a solid foundation.

32
00:01:44,673 --> 00:01:48,543
This section is about building
that solid starting foundation.

33
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:52,155
Quick reminder, you
are building a machine.

34
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:56,709
A system that creates value for
customers delivers meaningful impact

35
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:58,889
and generates sustainable economics.

36
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:01,415
All three models need to work together.

37
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:02,456
They're not separate.

38
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,590
They're interconnected.

39
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:07,775
A strong customer model affects
your economics, efficient impact

40
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:12,065
activities, reduce your costs
better economics, let you serve more

41
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,195
customers and deliver more impact.

42
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,612
This systematic improvement work right
now is how you make sure that the machine

43
00:02:19,612 --> 00:02:21,232
you're building will actually work

44
00:02:22,062 --> 00:02:23,322
time to get systematic.

45
00:02:23,622 --> 00:02:25,422
We'll start with your customer model.

46
00:02:25,748 --> 00:02:28,718
Let's see if it's strong enough
to get you to product market fit,

47
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:30,132
and if not, how to make it better.
