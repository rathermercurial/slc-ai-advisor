# Generic/Core Program

The Generic (Core) program is the foundational Social Lean Canvas learning journey designed for a broad social entrepreneur audience. It provides comprehensive set of guided steps for building purpose-driven ventures that combine business models with impact models.

## Program Overview

The Generic program serves ventures across all sectors, stages, and legal structures. It provides a step by step process to guide users to:

- Design business models that create both financial sustainability and measurable social/environmental impact
- Map these ventures using the 11-section Social Lean Canvas framework
- Systematically improve and validate their business models
- Develop executable strategies for building successful purpose-driven ventures

**Target Audience:** Social enterprises, community ventures, cooperatives, nonprofits with earned income, mission-led startups, solo ventures, and other purpose-driven organizations.

**Program Structure:** Two distinct sub-programs that can be delivered together or separately:

| Sub-Program                | Modules | Purpose                          | Outcome                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Social Lean Canvas** | 2.0-3.2 | Create first draft canvas        | Complete 11-section canvas mapping venture        |
| **Build**                  | 4.0-5.3 | Improve model & develop strategy | Strengthened business model + executable strategy |



## Two-Part Program Structure

### 1. The Social Lean Canvas (Modules 2.0-3.2)

**Learning Objective:** Guide entrepreneurs through creating a complete first-draft Social Lean Canvas that maps their entire venture on one page.

**Content Coverage:**

- **Module 2.0 - Introduction:** Program orientation, understanding purpose-driven ventures
- **Module 3.0 - Business Model Design:**
  - **3.1 - Understanding Business Model Design:** Business model fundamentals, the 3-circles model, venture examples
  - **3.2 - Fill In Your Canvas:** Step-by-step guidance for completing all 11 canvas sections

**The 11 Canvas Sections:**

See [Content README](content/readme.md) for detailed breakdown of all 11 canvas sections and the Three Models framework.

**Pedagogical Approach:** Video-guided instruction walking entrepreneurs through each concept and canvas section, supported by venture examples from the example library.

### 2. Build (Modules 4.0-5.3)

**Learning Objective:** Transform a completed first-draft canvas into a strengthened business model with an executable strategy to validate and build it.

**Content Coverage:**

#### Module 4.0 - Improving Your Business Model

Systematic improvement of the three core models through assessment, lever exploration, and iteration:

- **4.1 - Introduction:** Overview of improvement process
- **4.2 - Improving Customer Model:** Assess customer segments, JTBD, UVP, and solution; explore improvement levers, iterate your model, capture assumptions
- **4.3 - Improving Impact Model:** Assess theory of change, improvement levers, iterate your model, capture assumptions
- **4.4 - Improving Economic Model:** Assess economics, improvement levers, iterate your model, capture assumptions
- **4.5 - Conclusion:** Integration and next steps

#### Module 5.0 - Developing Your Strategy

Turn improved business model into executable validation and development strategy:

- **5.1 - Designing Your Strategy:**
  - Assess venture stage (idea, early, growth, scale)
  - Understand validation principles
  - Create validation plans for Customer, Impact, and Economic models
- **5.2 - Building Your Strategy:**
  - Integrate validation plans into coherent timeline
  - Map business model strategy, organizational strategy, and capital strategy
  - Create executable roadmap for immediate, short-term, and medium-term horizons

## The Three Models Framework

The Social Lean Canvas organizes ventures into three interconnected models. See [Content README](content/readme.md) for detailed canvas sections and module navigation.

**Brief Overview:**

### 1. Customer Model

**Canvas Sections:** Customers, Jobs To Be Done, Unique Value Proposition, Solution

**Model Purpose:** Maps how the venture creates value for customers - who they serve, what needs they address, why customers choose this solution, and what's delivered.

### 2. Impact Model

**Canvas Sections:** Impact (7-field causality chain)

**Model Purpose:** Theory of change showing how venture activities lead to measurable social/environmental outcomes over time.

### 3. Economic Model

**Canvas Sections:** Channels, Revenue, Costs, Advantage

**Model Purpose:** Maps how money flows through the venture - customer acquisition/delivery channels, revenue sources, cost structure, and sustainable competitive advantage.

**These three models plus Purpose and Key Metrics constitute the complete 11-section Social Lean Canvas.**

## Using This README

### For the AI Advisor

**Content Navigation:**

- Use module numbers to locate specific content (e.g., "3.2.2" for customer model section)
- Filter by tags to find canvas-section-specific content
- Distinguish between Canvas program (2.0-3.2) and Build program (4.0-5.3)
- Reference venture examples from `examples/` to illustrate concepts, determine relevance based on matching tags and concepts
- See [Content README](content/readme.md) for file naming conventions and tagging patterns

**User Guidance:**

- Route users to Canvas program (2.0-3.2) when creating first draft
- Route users to Build program (4.0-5.3) when improving existing canvas or developing strategy

**Content Hierarchy:**

- Top-level module files (e.g., `3.0`, `4.0`) provide overviews
- Sub-modules dive into specific topics
- Use nested structure to find detailed content (up to 4 levels deep)

### For Human Maintainers

**Adding Content:**

- Place new canvas-creation content in `3.0 business-model-design/`
- Place improvement content in `4.0 improving-your-business-model/`
- Place strategy content in `5.0 developing-your-strategy/`
- Follow module numbering hierarchy (X.0 → X.Y → X.Y.Z → X.Y.Z.N)

**Tagging Strategy:**

- TBD
