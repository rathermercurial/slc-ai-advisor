# Solution

## Definition

**Solution** describes what your enterprise actually does - your product or service. Your solution is what's going to deliver the value to your customers in a way that at least some of them will pay for.

This is the concrete manifestation of your unique value proposition - the actual offering that gets the job done for customers, delivers the value promised in your unique value propisition AND creates the impact outlined in your impact model.

Keep the description of your solution simple and high level. You don't need to go into great detail, but make sure that you cover off the key aspects of it so that it clearly shows both how you're going to create customer value and impact.

## Core Principles

### Dual Purpose: Customer Value and Impact

- Your solution must deliver the value promised to customers
- It must also create the social or environmental impact mapped in your impact model
- The same activities often serve both purposes simultaneously but could instead be completely separate parts of your venture
- Describe the parts of your solution that will deliver both customer value and impact activities

### Simple and High-Level Description

- Keep the description simple and high-level if you are going through the canvas for the first time you can build out the detail later. 
- Focus on the key aspects that clearly show how you create value and impact. Make sure you describe what is special and unique about your solution

### Connects All Elements

- Your solution ties together both customer types (if you have multiple) and segments. You may have multiple customer types but only one solution
- It delivers the value of the UVP to the customers to achieve their JTBD as well as delivering on the purpose and impact goals
- It's the vehicle by which customer needs are met and impact is achieved
- Everything in your customer model should logically connect through your solution

### Not Features, But Core Offering

- Focus on what you do, not detailed features or specifications
- Describe your offering in customer-understandable terms
- Think about how you would explain your business to someone new
- Keep it accessible and simple, develop out the detail of the product / service deeper into the development of your business model

## Why Solution Matters

### Foundation for Business Model Viability

Your solution is the core of your business model - it's what customers pay for and what creates your impact. Without a clear, compelling solution that addresses real customer needs, your venture cannot succeed financially or socially.

### Bridge Between Vision and Reality

The solution section transforms your purpose, customer understanding, and impact goals into something concrete and actionable. It's where strategy becomes tangible.

It delivers the value in you customer model, and makes it possible for your economic model to work. 

### Operational Clarity

A well-defined solution provides clarity for your team about what you're building, it is the starting point for product development, service delivery, and operational decisions.

### Customer Communication Foundation

Your solution description becomes the basis for explaining your offering to customers, partners, and stakeholders. It should be clear enough that others can understand and explain what you do.

## Implementation Approach

1. **Start with Customer Value** - Ensure your solution directly addresses the jobs to be done you've identified
2. **Include Impact Activities** - Describe how your solution also creates the impact
3. **Keep It Customer-Focused** - Write in language that customers would understand and use
4. **Test for Clarity** - Can someone unfamiliar with your venture understand what you do from this description?
5. **Connect the Dots** - Make sure your solution logically delivers your unique value proposition
6. **Think Holistically** - Include all key components of your offering, not just the main product 
## Common Pitfalls 

- **Feature Lists**: Describing specific features instead of the overall offering 
- **Internal Language**: Using technical jargon that customers wouldn't understand 
- **Too Detailed**: Getting lost in specifics that belong in product documentation
- **Disconnected from UVP**: Solution that doesn't clearly deliver the promised value
- **Missing Impact Component**: Forgetting to describe how the solution creates impact
- **Too Vague**: Being so high-level that it's unclear what you actually do
