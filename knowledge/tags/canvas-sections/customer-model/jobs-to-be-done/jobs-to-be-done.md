# jobs-to-be-done

## Definition
The `jobs-to-be-done` tag identifies content about Jobs to be Done (JTBD) - the core tasks, needs, or motivations driving customers to engage with the enterprise's solution.

## Usage Criteria
Apply this tag to content that:
- Explains the JTBD framework and methodology
- Provides guidance on identifying customer jobs
- Discusses JTBD analysis techniques
- Explores the relationship between jobs and solutions

## Always Include When
- Content focuses on JTBD framework application
- Customer job identification methodologies
- JTBD analysis and research approaches
- Job statement formulation guidance

## Never Include When
- Content is about existing alternatives specifically (use `existing-alternatives`)
- General customer needs content not using JTBD framework
- Product feature discussions not tied to underlying jobs

## Required Combinations
- Must include appropriate canvas-sections hierarchy: [customer-model, jobs-to-be-done]
- Often combined with `existing-alternatives` when content covers both

## Content Examples
- JTBD framework explanations
- Job identification interview techniques
- Job statement templates and examples
- JTBD case study analysis

## Related Tags
- Parent tags: [customer-model](../customer-model.md)
- Child tag: [existing-alternatives](existing-alternatives/existing-alternatives.md)
- Often appears with [customers](../customers/customers.md) (whose jobs are being analyzed)
- May combine with [solution](../solution/solution.md) (jobs inform solution design)

## Hierarchy
- [Existing Alternatives](existing-alternatives/existing-alternatives.md) - Current solutions customers use for these jobs

## Key Concepts
- Functional, emotional, and social job dimensions
- Job triggers and circumstances
- Job outcomes and success criteria
- Progress customers want to make
- "Hiring" products to do jobs
