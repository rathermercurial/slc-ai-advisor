<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span>
You're about to work through the Core content on improving your impact model. This is where you assess whether your theory of change actually holds up and how to make it stronger.

The Core Framework covers diagnostic checks, testing your logic, systems thinking and complexity science, the efficiency lens, and strategic improvement approaches.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Test logic | Systems lens | Find efficiency | Improve systematically]**

Fair warning: some of this work - particularly the systems thinking and complexity science - can be resource-intensive. Deep systems mapping takes time and expertise. Watch for how the Core Framework approaches this, but know you'll need to design for your capacity as a solo founder or small team.

Pay attention to the efficiency lens. The Core Framework asks: what's the most effective way to generate the impact you're going for? For P2P ventures, this question matters even more.

After the Core content, we'll talk about what impact model improvement looks like when you're working solo or with a small team.

**Tag line:** **Make impact efficient.**

## P2P COMMENTARY

p2p 4.3 improving-your-impact-model 2.webm.02.mp4.webm

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Impact Model for PPVs"]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just walked you through improving your impact model. Testing your logic, using systems thinking, finding efficiency, strategic approaches like partnership and copying from others.

Now let's talk about what this means for Purpose Pivot Ventures like yours

**Tag line:** **P2P impact strategy.**

---

### The Purpose Spectrum

**[MAIN PANEL: Spectrum diagram from personal transformation to systemic impact]**

Back when we filled in the Impact Model, we talked about the purpose spectrum. On one end, ventures where purpose is about personal transformation - building a better life for yourself and your family. On the other end, ventures driving systemic social or environmental change.

Both are valid. Both are P2P ventures.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Personal transformation ← → Systemic change | Both valid]**

If your purpose sits more toward the personal transformation end - if your venture is primarily about creating freedom and meaning for yourself - you might not need deep impact model improvement work.

The questions to ask yourself: Can you deliver on the purpose you're going for? Will you get the outcomes you actually want? Is the basic logic sound?

If yes, that might be enough. You don't need extensive systems mapping or complex impact frameworks. Your impact model can stay light.

**Tag line:** **Match depth to purpose.**

---

### Design is Never Neutral

**[MAIN PANEL: Ripple effects diagram]**

But regardless of where you sit on the spectrum. Remember that Design is never neutral. Every venture creates ripple effects beyond its direct intentions.

Even if your impact model is light - even if you're focused on personal transformation - your venture will have effects on others. Customers, communities, environments.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Every venture creates ripples | Intended + unintended]**

Think through what could go wrong. Who might be harmed, even unintentionally? What negative impacts could stem from your venture?

This is part of Honest Hustle. Eyes open, values aligned. You're building something that reflects who you are. Make sure it doesn't accidentally create harm you wouldn't want associated with your work.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Hustle Honest]**

**Tag line:** Hustle Honest.\*\*

### Efficiency is Critical for Impact-Focused PPVs

**[MAIN PANEL: Intervention points diagram]**

Now, if your venture is more impact-focused - if you're trying to drive meaningful change in the world - efficiency becomes a primary focus.

The Core Framework showed you the efficiency lens. Is your impact model the most effective way to generate the impact you're trying to achieve?

This matters even more when you're solo or a small team. You don't have unlimited resources to throw at impact activities.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Limited resources | Must be efficient | Root cause focus]**

Look for root cause interventions rather than downstream activities. The Core Framework showed the domestic violence example - helping husbands find jobs was more efficient than years of victim based services.

Find the leverage points in the system where small interventions create outsized change. Don't try to address everything. Find where you can have the most impact with the least resource expenditure.

The Toast Ale example from the Core content demonstrates this well. They intervene at the food waste recovery point - turning surplus bread into beer. Direct waste reduction, immediate emissions avoided, and they fund environmental charities with the profits. Clean efficiency.

**Tag line:** **Find your leverage point.**

---

### Design for Your Capacity

**[MAIN PANEL: Systems map with complexity indicators]**

The Core Framework went deep on systems thinking and complexity science. Understanding the larger system, identifying leverage points, managing unintended consequences.

This is powerful work. It can also be resource-intensive.

Deep systems mapping takes time. Understanding complexity dynamics requires expertise. As a p2p venture you need to design for your capacity.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Systems work is deep | Design for capacity | Use what exists]**

You don't need to map the entire system yourself from scratch. Use existing research. Learn from organizations that have already done this work in your impact area.

The Core Framework emphasized this: copy from others. If someone has already figured out how the system works and where the intervention points are, use that knowledge.

**Tag line:** **Build on existing knowledge.**

---

### Partnership as a Strategy

**[MAIN PANEL: Partnership diagram showing load reduction]**

For 2p2 ventures, partnership is often the best strategy for efficient impact delivery.

This reduces the load on your business model dramatically.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Partner vs. build | Fund expansion | Reduce load]**

Partnership lets you focus on your core business model while still driving the impact you care about.

Maybe you partner with an organization that's already doing the work well. You fund their expansion into new areas or new populations. They deliver the impact activities. You handle your business model.

Or you partner with an organization that holds one piece of the solution while you hold another. Together you're more effective than either could be alone.

**Tag line:** **Partner to reduce load.**

---

### Example: Buy Me Once

**[MAIN PANEL: Buy Me Once canvas - Impact Model section]**

Let's look at Buy Me Once. They show how you can deliver meaningful impact without massive impact overhead on your business model.

Buy Me Once exists to reduce waste by helping consumers find products that last. Their purpose is environmental - combating throwaway culture and planned obsolescence.

They could have approached this with heavy impact activities. Running repair workshops. Creating educational campaigns. Lobbying manufacturers. All important work, but all resource-intensive.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Could have: Workshops | Campaigns | Lobbying | Resource-intensive]**

Instead, they chose an efficient intervention point: curation and platform.

They curate products that are genuinely durable and repairable. They create a marketplace where consumers can find these products easily. They provide information that helps people make better purchasing decisions.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Actually: Curate | Platform | Information | Efficient]**

**[MAIN PANEL: Show impact flow]**

Their impact happens through consumer choice, not through activities they directly run.

Each purchase through their platform is a purchase of a durable product instead of a disposable one. Each product review helps other consumers make informed choices. The cumulative effect drives demand for better-made goods and shifts market dynamics.

Their intervention point is elegant. They don't manufacture the products. They don't run the repair services. They don't operate the recycling programs. They connect consumers with products that last.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Don't make products | Don't run repairs | Connect consumers | Market shift]**

This creates real environmental impact - waste reduction, resource conservation, behavior change - without requiring them to deliver complex impact activities themselves.

The business model is sustainable at small scale. A lean team can run the platform, curate products, and maintain the community. The impact compounds as the platform grows, but the operational load stays manageable.

**[MAIN PANEL: Return to full Impact Model canvas]**

That's the efficiency lens in action. They found an intervention point that delivers impact without overwhelming the business model.

**Tag line:** **Efficient intervention point.**

---

### Use AI for Impact Research

**[MAIN PANEL: Research workflow diagram]**

Throughout the improvement process, use AI tools to accelerate your work.

Research existing impact models in your space. What approaches have others taken? What's proven to work? What assumptions have been validated?

Map stakeholders and intervention points. Who's already working on this issue? Where are the leverage points in the system?

Find partnership opportunities. Which organizations might be good partners for impact delivery?

Generate ideas for more efficient approaches you might not have considered.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Research models | Map stakeholders | Find partners | Generate ideas]**

AI won't replace decision-making based on lived experience and first hand experimentation. But it can dramatically accelerate the research and analysis that informs those decisions.

**Tag line:** **AI accelerates research.**

---

### Your Turn

**[MAIN PANEL: Impact Model section on blank canvas]**

Now follow the instructions in the core content on improving your impact model.

But make sure you are taking do this in relation to the specific needs of your venture, accounting for where you are on the purpose/impact spectrum and the scale that you are going for with your p2p venture.

Check the example libraries for ventures with similar impact goals. See how they structured their impact models for efficiency.

And document your assumptions about your impact model. You'll test these when you start validating.

p2p 4.3 improving-your-impact-model 1.webm.02.mp4.webm
1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,679
You're about to work through the core
content on improving your impact model.

2
00:00:04,039 --> 00:00:07,579
This is where you'll assess whether
your theory of change actually holds

3
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:09,250
up and how to make it stronger.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,669
The core framework covers things
like diagnostic checks, testing your

5
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:18,531
logic, systems thinking and complexity
science, the efficiency lens and

6
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:20,361
strategic improvement approaches.

7
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:20,496
Okay.

8
00:00:20,686 --> 00:00:21,316
Fair warning.

9
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:24,466
Some of this work, particularly
the systems thinking and complexity

10
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:26,788
science can be resource intensive.

11
00:00:26,962 --> 00:00:29,962
Deep systems mapping
takes time and expertise.

12
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,792
Watch for how the core framework
approaches this, but you'll need

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,852
to design for your capacity as
a solo founder or small team.

14
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:40,050
Pay attention to the efficiency lens.

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,456
The core framework asks what's
the most effective way to generate

16
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:45,746
the impact you're going for?

17
00:00:45,907 --> 00:00:50,749
For P two P Ventures, this question
matters even more after the core content.

18
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:54,242
We'll talk about what impact model
improvement looks like when you're

19
00:00:54,242 --> 00:00:56,162
working solo or with a small team.

p2p 4.3 improving-your-impact-model 2.webm.02.mp4.webm

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,334
The core framework just walked you through
improving your impact model, testing your

2
00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:09,164
logic, using systems thinking, finding
efficiency, strategic approaches like

3
00:00:09,164 --> 00:00:10,244
partnering and copying from others.

4
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:15,197
Now let's talk about what this means
for a P two P venture like yours.

5
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:19,936
Back when we filled in the impact
model section of the canvas, we talked

6
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:25,151
about the purpose spectrum on one
End Ventures, where purpose is about

7
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:28,991
personal transformation, building a
better life for yourself and your family.

8
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:33,629
On the other end Ventures driving
systemic social or environmental

9
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:35,612
change, both are valid.

10
00:00:35,622 --> 00:00:37,328
Both are P two P ventures.

11
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:41,751
If your venture sits more towards
the personal transformation end,

12
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:45,168
if your venture is primarily
about creating freedom and meaning

13
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:48,779
for yourself, you might not need
deep impact model improvement.

14
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:52,821
Work the questions to ask
yourself, can you deliver on the

15
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:54,201
purpose that you're going for?

16
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:56,801
Will you get the outcomes
that you actually want?

17
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:59,101
Is the basic logic sound.

18
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:00,916
If yes, that might be enough.

19
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:05,364
You don't need extensive systems
mapping or complex impact frameworks.

20
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:07,194
Your impact model can stay light.

21
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:11,210
But regardless of where you
sit on the spectrum, remember

22
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,920
that design is never neutral.

23
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:17,515
Every venture creates ripple effects
beyond its direct intentions.

24
00:01:18,072 --> 00:01:20,802
Even if your impact model is
light, even if you're focused

25
00:01:20,802 --> 00:01:24,316
on personal transformation, your
venture will have effects on others.

26
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:29,670
Customers, communities, environments,
think through what could go wrong, what

27
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,070
might be harmed even unintentionally.

28
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:35,366
What negative impacts could
stem from your venture?

29
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:37,477
This is part of honest hustle.

30
00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:39,340
Eyes open values aligned.

31
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:41,734
You're building something
that reflects who you are.

32
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,004
Make sure it doesn't accidentally
create harm you wouldn't want

33
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,204
associated with your work.

34
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,570
Now, if your ventures more impact
focused, if you're trying to drive

35
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,408
meaningful change in the world,
efficiency becomes a primary focus.

36
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:57,614
The core framework showed
you the efficiency lens.

37
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,300
Is your impact model the most
effective way to generate the

38
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,650
impact you're trying to achieve?

39
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,400
This matters even more if
you're solo or a small team.

40
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:10,291
You don't have unlimited resources
to throw at impact activity.

41
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:15,774
Look for root cause interventions
rather than downstream activities.

42
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:19,524
The core framework showed the
domestic violence example.

43
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:23,355
Helping husbands find jobs
was more efficient than years

44
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:24,885
of victim based services.

45
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:29,116
Find the leverage points in the
system where small interventions

46
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,826
create outsize change.

47
00:02:31,124 --> 00:02:32,761
Don't try and address everything.

48
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:36,511
Find the leverage points in the
system where small interventions

49
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:38,191
create outsize change.

50
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:40,229
Don't try and address everything.

51
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,939
Find where you can have the most impact
with the least resource expenditure.

52
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,310
The Toast Ale example from the core
content demonstrates this well.

53
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:53,875
They intervene at the food waste
recovery point, turning surplus bread

54
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,258
into beer, direct waste reduction.

55
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:59,224
Immediate emissions avoided,
and then they fund environmental

56
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:00,864
charities with the profits.

57
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:02,264
Clean efficiency.

58
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:07,392
The core framework went deep systems
thinking and complexity science.

59
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:11,035
Understanding the larger system,
identifying leverage points,

60
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,897
managing unintended consequences.

61
00:03:13,557 --> 00:03:14,834
This is powerful work.

62
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,294
It can also be very resource intensive.

63
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:19,784
Deep systems mapping takes time.

64
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:23,243
Understanding complexity
dynamics requires expertise.

65
00:03:23,694 --> 00:03:27,106
As a P two P venture, you need
to design for your capacity.

66
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:31,000
You don't have to map the entire
system yourself from scratch.

67
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,500
Use existing research.

68
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,840
Learn from organizations that have already
done this work in your impact area.

69
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:38,247
Copy from others.

70
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,887
If someone's already figured out how the
system works and where the intervention

71
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:44,499
points are, use this knowledge.

72
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:48,796
For P two P ventures, partnership
is often the best strategy

73
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:50,266
for efficient impact delivery.

74
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:53,076
This reduces the load on your
business model dramatically.

75
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:57,404
Partnership lets you focus on your
core business model while still

76
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,114
driving the impact you care about.

77
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:02,836
Maybe you partner with an organization
that's already doing the work.

78
00:04:02,836 --> 00:04:06,843
Well, you fund their expansion
into new areas or new populations.

79
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:08,947
They deliver the impact activities.

80
00:04:08,977 --> 00:04:13,814
You handle your business model or you
partner with an organization that holds

81
00:04:13,814 --> 00:04:18,270
one piece of the solution while you hold
the other together, you're more effective

82
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,800
than either of you could be alone.

83
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:23,245
Let's look at Buy Me Once as an example.

84
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:27,109
They show how you can deliver
meaningful impact without massive

85
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:29,119
impact overheads on your business model.

86
00:04:29,555 --> 00:04:34,505
Buy Me Once exists to reduce waste by
helping consumers find products that last.

87
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:38,547
Their purpose is environmental,
combating, throwaway culture,

88
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:40,017
and planned obsolescence.

89
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:44,726
They could have approached this with
heavy impact activities, running repair

90
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:49,979
workshops, creating educational campaigns,
lobbying manufacturers, all important

91
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,929
work, but all resource intensive.

92
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:56,655
Instead, they chose an efficient
intervention point, curation and platform.

93
00:04:57,084 --> 00:05:00,894
They curate products that are
genuinely durable and repairable.

94
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:04,818
They create a marketplace where
consumers can find these products easily.

95
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:08,833
They provide information that helps
people make better purchasing decisions.

96
00:05:09,462 --> 00:05:13,067
Their impact happens through customer
choice, not through activities.

97
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:13,997
They directly run.

98
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,362
Each purchase through their platform
is a purchase of a durable product

99
00:05:18,392 --> 00:05:19,892
instead of a disposable one.

100
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:24,218
Each product review helps other
customers make informed decisions.

101
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:27,835
The cumulative effect, drive
demands for better made goods

102
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:28,975
and shifts market dynamics.

103
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:32,037
Their intervention point is elegant.

104
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:34,171
They don't manufacture the products.

105
00:05:34,473 --> 00:05:36,243
They don't run the repair service.

106
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:38,668
They don't operate the recycling program.

107
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:40,879
They connect customers with products that.

108
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:45,343
This creates real environmental
impact, waste reduction, resource

109
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,965
conservation, behavioral change
without requiring them to deliver

110
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:51,283
complex impact activities themselves.

111
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:54,372
The business model is
sustainable at small scale.

112
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,005
A lean team can run the platform, curate
products, and maintain the community.

113
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:03,959
The impact compounds as the platform
grows, but the operation stays manageable.

114
00:06:04,928 --> 00:06:06,728
That's the efficiency lens in action.

115
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:09,920
They found an intervention point
that delivers impact without

116
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,390
overwhelming the business model.

117
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,559
Throughout the improvement process,
use AI tools to accelerate your work,

118
00:06:16,955 --> 00:06:22,193
research existing impact models in your
space, what approaches have others taken?

119
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:23,613
What's proven to work?

120
00:06:23,873 --> 00:06:25,699
What assumptions have been validated?

121
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:28,526
Map stakeholders and intervention points.

122
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:30,296
Who's already working on the issue?

123
00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:32,546
Where are the leverage
points in the system?

124
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:34,794
Find partnership opportunities.

125
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:38,484
What organizations might be good
partners for impact delivery?

126
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:41,465
Generate ideas for more
efficient approaches that you

127
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:42,605
might not have considered.

128
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:47,491
AI won't replace decision making based
on lived experience and firsthand

129
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:51,998
experimentation, but it can dramatically
accelerate the research and analysis

130
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:53,527
that informs those decisions.

131
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:58,434
Now follow the instructions and the core
content on improving your impact model.

132
00:06:58,903 --> 00:07:02,863
Make sure that you are doing this
in relation to the specific needs

133
00:07:02,863 --> 00:07:06,053
of your venture accounting for
where you are on the purpose, impact

134
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:09,839
spectrum and the scale that you are
going for with your P two P venture.

135
00:07:10,357 --> 00:07:14,975
Check the example libraries for ventures
with similar impact goals and see how

136
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:19,005
they structured their impact models
for efficiency and document your

137
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,685
assumptions and your impact model.

138
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:23,083
You'll test these when
you start validating.
