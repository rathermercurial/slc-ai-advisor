## Impact Chain

### Issue
Global food waste crisis: one-third of food produced is wasted, causing 10% of greenhouse gas emissions and massive environmental degradation.

### Participants
Food businesses, environmentally conscious consumers, food service workers, local communities, environmental organizations, and policymakers working to reduce food waste.

### Activities
Surplus food redistribution, impact tracking, community building, education campaigns, policy advocacy, industry partnerships, and technology innovation for systemic change.

### Short-Term Outcomes
Direct food waste reduction, individual behavior change, business revenue recovery, measurable environmental impact, and increased community awareness.

### Medium-Term Outcomes
Scaling impact, industry standard changes, cultural shifts toward sustainability, business model innovation, and supportive policy development.

### Long-Term Outcomes
Systemic food system transformation, significant climate impact, permanent consumer behavior change, industry-wide operational improvements, and global awareness.

### Impact
A world without food waste where businesses, consumers, and systems prioritize environmental sustainability, contributing significantly to global climate goals.

Please note, this impact model has been compiled from publicly available data. It is a best estimate of this organization's impact model but information may be out of date and/or could differ from the organization's own description of their impact model.
