## Trailer notes

Intro can be a short trailer on it's own or the start of the main trailer. 
1. **Intro**
	1. "People are Pivoting to purpose - getting away from boring, soul crushing work by building venture that matter to them... that bring wealth as well as meaning.  
	2. Pivoting to purpose, is when you realize that working for someone else on things that don't matter to you is no longer what you want. And when you make a commitment to building something that can "
	3. Tagline - purpose pivoting - harnessing the emerging opportunities that are coming up in a change world - honest hustle - building success with your soul intact. 
	4. The SLC system provides a clear step by step roadmap and a comprehensive video program, to take you from idea to successful venture. This is the smart low risk iterative path to success.
	5. This isn't sleezy internet hustle culture. This is about the honest hustle. This is about bringing the BEST of yourself, being smart, being strategic and changing YOUR life, and beyond.
	6. The Social Lean Canvas program is open source and completely free. 

2. **Why now?**
	1. There is a unique possibility space opening up right now:
		1. Uncertainty in the world is increasing. Traditional jobs are being disrupted and whole industries are going to die and jobs we thought would be there forever are going to vanish. 
		2. But with this disruption comes an opportunity to reinvent the world in unprecedented ways. People are stepping away from traditional jobs and into building their own solo-ventures. AI is acting as a force multiplier, we are seeing the rise of small enterprises where one person can harness new tools to build something that previously would have taken a giant team to execute on. 
		   
	2. **The one person startup is real** - In the past, creating a new untested venture usually involved getting startup capital from early investors to hire a team to help you build. This then set an entrepreneur on a course of growing a high-growth business that they could eventually sell in order for the investors to generate their return. But today there are many ways that an entrepreneur can start out without needing investment capital. This makes possible a completely different approach to building ventures. We can make something that we can create and grow on our own terms, and not immediately adopt all of the values and compromises of being a high-growth startup. 
	3. Ref https://a16z.com/as-more-workers-go-solo-the-software-stack-is-the-new-firm/ - diagram showing how the functions of a business are being replaced with a software stack and AI
	4. Honest hustle - building success with your soul intact.  - It is individuals and small teams that will reshape the business world by bringing their creativity and hard work. But this can't just be the self-serving/hyper-individualistic hustle culture we see everywhere online. The opportunity we have is to build things that succeed but without losing our souls in the process. 
	5. As we pivot away from the traditional working world and into building our own ventures, we can integrate our own sense of purpose into what we are creating. This adventure into entrepreneurship can be more fully ours, more satisfying and, as a result, more likely to succeed.
	6. **Integrating your purpose is a complete no-brainer** - Whether you are building something to change the world or just trying to feed your family, integrating your purpose into what you are doing in today's world is a complete no-brainer. In a world where things are becoming increasingly uncertain and untrustworthy, purpose driven initiatives are the things that can cut through the slop. Customers of ventures that have purpose a their heart are more engaged, more loyal, and more likely to refer others to your venture. 
3. **You are not creating a Job you are creating a business model you are creating a machine** - In the past moving from a stable job to doing your own thing meant giving up certainty and trading it for the uncertain life of a freelancer or consultant. But pivoting towards purpose is more about building a machine that you own that produces more value than you can by yourself, that gives you leverage on your time. That creates financial independence for you as well as more of the good things that you are trying to manifest in the world.
	
4. **The SLC** -  
	1. The slc system has been evolved over 10 years to be the fastest and most reliable way to map, test and build - ideas into successful business models. It's been used with thousands of social ventures,  accelerator and incubator programs to bring coherence to the innovation process and help people build their ideas into machines that can produce more good things in the world. 
5. **Low risk** - It gives your a low-risk iterative pathway that can be followed alongside your current job, so you make the switch only when you know your venture can support you to do so. 
6. This is not about answering your questions, your situation is unique, no one can answer your questions for your. The SLC is about giving you the tools to answer your own questions. From now on, when you have an idea for a venture  pivoting towards purpose you will be able to use the canvas system to figure out if it can work and to guide you to making this happen. 
7. **See the wood And the trees** - it also allows you to get deep into the details, while still having a high-level view of your venture to keep you on-track and grounded in reality.  
8. **How it works**
9. The canvas maps out the key aspects of your idea into a comprehensive business model on a single page. This weaves together a customer model - how your venture will create value for customers, an impact model - a logic to map how your venture will deliver on your purpose and an economic model - how money will flow through your enterprise in a way that can make it successful.
   This program helps you refine and improve these parts of your business model and then create a strategy to validate them, to see if the assumptions in the business model hold up in reality. 
10. As you follow this strategy and your venture evolves and improves, uncertainty is replaced with proof that your idea can succeed and you can safely commit more time and resources into making it a reality. 
11. "Pivoting to purpose" (tm) walks you through these steps with the goal  engine that can reliably produce the wealth you want while delivering on your purpose goals as well. 
12. Low risk - You can do this 
13. We are making this available to you for free....open source etc
