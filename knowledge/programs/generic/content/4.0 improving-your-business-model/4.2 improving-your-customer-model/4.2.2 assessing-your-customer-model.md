# Assess Your Customer Model

Now let's assess whether your customer model is strong enough. Fundamentally you are asking 2 question: 
1. Do I have the right product, to deliver the right value proposition, to get the job done for my customer segment? Ie will my customers engage and pay for my solution?
2. And second is my customer segment large enough and will they each pay enough to make the business model work?

You are going to validate question by engaging with real customers in the strategy module up next. But before doing this, you need to have some of question 2 and be confident, at least on paper, your customer model could work. 

We can frame this up using 2 simple concepts - TAM and ARPU.

**TAM** - Total Addressable Market - is the total number of customers inside a tightly defined customer segment. Individual customers, with your specific job to be done, inside a single geography or channel.

Use available data and AI tools to help you calculate the TAM for your customer segments. This gives you a ballpark on how many customers you can potentially serve.

`[VISUAL TEXT: TAM = total customers in defined segment]`

**ARPU** - Average Revenue Per User - is what a particular customer in your customer segment is likely to pay for your product or service. That is the average total revenue you are likely to get per customer usually calculated on a monthly basis.  

Again, use available data and AI tools to create this estimate.

`[VISUAL TEXT: ARPU = spending power | need strength | perceived value | alternatives]`

These two calculations - while still ballpark figures - give you more detail than the back of the napkin numbers you might have used for your first pass through the canvas.

**TAM times ARPU equals your revenue potential.**

This lets you compare customer segments and get a sense of whether they could provide enough revenue to make the business model work.

### Common Weaknesses to Look For

As you assess, watch for these commone issues:

Your segment is too small for your unit economics to work.

Your ARPU is too low to reach breakeven at a realistic scale.

Your early adopters don't actually signal a bigger market.

Or if you have multiple customer types, they're not working together in an integrated way.

If your customer model doesn't look good enough to get you to product-market fit, you need to fix it now. If you push forward with a weak model, you'll find it increasingly hard to change and improve it later.

Here are the strategic levers you can pull to improve it.
