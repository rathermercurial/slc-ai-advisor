Just as your customer model describes how you create customer value, your impact model shows how you create social value. It shows how your activities are going to generate positive social or environmental outcomes that will then create your long-term impact.

Based on what you've described in the purpose section of the canvas, your impact model will show the chain of causality, the logic by which your intentions will translate into impact that will actually occur in the world. And this will get you beyond mere hopes and assumptions about the positive change you're going to cause and get real about how this will actually happen.

Depending on what you're trying to achieve, your impact model will be more or less complicated. This template will allow you to sketch out each component of your impact model as a simple starting point for you to build on. This is just one template for developing an impact model. There are many others. So feel free to use a different one if you know it better, or if it's the one used by your organization, funder, or program that you're in.

If your impact model is relatively simple, it may have just a single line that maps your impact from issue through to final impact. But if it's more complex, then you may have several and they may interact in complex ways. If this is the case, it's gonna take a bit more time and effort to develop your impact model. That said, also make sure that you're not making your impact model more complex than it needs to be. It can be tempting to add in every positive thing that your business could do, but keep it simple by focusing only on the impact components that truly align with your purpose.

This impact logic you're creating here tells the story of how the things you do will solve real issues for real people in a predictable and measurable way. But of course, there are often many, many more factors causing these issues than you could hope to address on your own. Complex problems cannot be solved with one simple fix. So your impact model needs to reflect that you understand the system that is producing the issues you want to solve, and that based on this understanding, your intervention often in conjunction with other people's work will influence the system in a significant and positive way.

### Issue

The issue section of your impact model draws directly from your purpose statement. The issue is the thing you're really trying to address with your enterprise, the problem you're trying to solve. For this first pass through the canvas, describe the issue in a high level way. But even though you're only going to describe it simply here in the canvas, you do need to understand it deeply. Or at least be on the journey to understanding it deeply. Otherwise, you can't hope to do anything useful about it.

### Participants

The participants in your impact model are your stakeholders, the people or organizations who will participate in your impact activities. This will include any core beneficiary groups that you're serving, as well as other key people and organizations who will engage with you on your impact activities. A participant might also be a customer in your custom model if they play a key role in making your broader business model work as well.

### Activities

Your activities are the things your participants will do because of your enterprise. They will ultimately lead to the impact that you want to have. Activities could be, for example, a participant group attends a training program you offer, install solar lighting, plants, trees, receives medical treatment, things like that. It'll be different for every impact model, but the activities need to be the things that ultimately cause the impact to happen. These impact activities will also be outlined in the solution section of your customer model.

### Short Term Outcomes

Following from the activities, you need to map out the short-term outcomes that will flow from them. These are the positive outcomes that will result immediately from your activities and be the first small step towards the impact that you're trying to have.

### Medium Term Outcomes

Medium term outcomes are the positive changes that will follow on from your short term outcomes. They are the measurable changes that are going to occur over the next, say, one to two years as a direct result of these short term outcomes.

### Long Term Outcomes

Your long-term outcomes are the long-term positive changes that will follow from your short and medium-term outcomes, perhaps across a two to 10-year time horizon.

### Impact

The final impact section of your impact model describes what the state of the world will be like when you have achieved your purpose. It is the destination of your activities and your short, medium, and long-term outcomes. It should be simple, short, and high level. It's okay for it to be a bit abstract. The detail you capture in your outcomes will make it concrete. It is describing the world after all the steps of your impact model have been delivered on.

## Tag Definition
The `impact` tag identifies content about the ultimate social or environmental change that emerges from long-term outcomes - the fundamental transformation the enterprise aims to achieve through its purpose.

## Sub-Components Structure
- [Issue](issue/issue.md) - Problem or opportunity being addressed
- [Participants](participants/participants.md) - Stakeholders involved in activities
- [Activities](activities/activities.md) - Actions taken to create change
- [Outputs](outputs/outputs.md) - Direct products of activities
- [Short-term Outcomes](short-term-outcomes/short-term-outcomes.md) - Initial changes (0-1 year)
- [Medium-term Outcomes](medium-term-outcomes/medium-term-outcomes.md) - Intermediate changes (1-3 years)
- [Long-term Outcomes](long-term-outcomes/long-term-outcomes.md) - Sustained changes (3+ years)
- [Impact](impact/impact.md) - Ultimate social/environmental change

## Usage Criteria
Apply this tag to content that:
- Defines ultimate impact vision and measurement
- Discusses long-term social/environmental change
- Provides frameworks for impact assessment
- Analyzes impact realization and attribution

## Always Include When
- Content focuses on ultimate change vision
- Impact statement development and articulation
- Long-term social/environmental transformation
- Impact measurement and evaluation approaches

## Never Include When
- Short or medium-term outcome content (use specific outcome tags)
- Output measurement (use `outputs`)
- General impact measurement not about ultimate impact

## Required Combinations
- Must include appropriate canvas-sections hierarchy: [impact-model, impact]

## Content Examples
- Impact statement development frameworks
- Ultimate impact assessment methodologies
- Long-term transformation measurement approaches
- Impact vision articulation methods
- Long-term impact case studies

## Related Tags
- Parent tags: [impact-model](../impact-model.md)

- Ultimate social/environmental change
- Systemic transformation
- Generational impact
- Attribution challenges
