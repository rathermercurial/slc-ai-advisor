<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
You're about to work through the Core content on improving your impact model. This is where you assess whether your theory of change actually holds up and how to make it stronger.

The Core Framework covers diagnostic checks, testing your logic, systems thinking and complexity science, the efficiency lens, and strategic improvement approaches.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Test logic | Systems lens | Find efficiency | Improve systematically]**

Fair warning: some of this work - particularly the systems thinking and complexity science - can be resource-intensive. Deep systems mapping takes time and expertise. Watch for how the Core Framework approaches this, but know you'll need to design for your capacity as a solo founder or small team.

Pay attention to the efficiency lens. The Core Framework asks: what's the most effective way to generate the impact you're going for? For P2P ventures, this question matters even more.

After the Core content, we'll talk about what impact model improvement looks like when you're working solo or with a small team.

**Tag line:** **Make impact efficient.**

## P2P COMMENTARY

p2p 4.3 improving-your-impact-model 2.webm.02.mp4.webm

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Impact Model for PPVs"]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just walked you through improving your impact model. Testing your logic, using systems thinking, finding efficiency, strategic approaches like partnership and copying from others.

Now let's talk about what this means for Purpose Pivot Ventures like yours

**Tag line:** **P2P impact strategy.**

---

### The Purpose Spectrum

**[MAIN PANEL: Spectrum diagram from personal transformation to systemic impact]**

Back when we filled in the Impact Model, we talked about the purpose spectrum. On one end, ventures where purpose is about personal transformation - building a better life for yourself and your family. On the other end, ventures driving systemic social or environmental change.

Both are valid. Both are P2P ventures.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Personal transformation ← → Systemic change | Both valid]**

If your purpose sits more toward the personal transformation end - if your venture is primarily about creating freedom and meaning for yourself - you might not need deep impact model improvement work.

The questions to ask yourself: Can you deliver on the purpose you're going for? Will you get the outcomes you actually want? Is the basic logic sound?

If yes, that might be enough. You don't need extensive systems mapping or complex impact frameworks. Your impact model can stay light.

**Tag line:** **Match depth to purpose.**

---

### Design is Never Neutral

**[MAIN PANEL: Ripple effects diagram]**

But regardless of where you sit on the spectrum. Remember that Design is never neutral. Every venture creates ripple effects beyond its direct intentions.

Even if your impact model is light - even if you're focused on personal transformation - your venture will have effects on others. Customers, communities, environments.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Every venture creates ripples | Intended + unintended]**

Think through what could go wrong. Who might be harmed, even unintentionally? What negative impacts could stem from your venture?

This is part of Honest Hustle. Eyes open, values aligned. You're building something that reflects who you are. Make sure it doesn't accidentally create harm you wouldn't want associated with your work.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Hustle Honest]**

**Tag line:** Hustle Honest.**

### Efficiency is Critical for Impact-Focused PPVs

**[MAIN PANEL: Intervention points diagram]**

Now, if your venture is more impact-focused - if you're trying to drive meaningful change in the world - efficiency becomes a primary focus.

The Core Framework showed you the efficiency lens. Is your impact model the most effective way to generate the impact you're trying to achieve?

This matters even more when you're solo or a small team. You don't have unlimited resources to throw at impact activities.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Limited resources | Must be efficient | Root cause focus]**

Look for root cause interventions rather than downstream activities. The Core Framework showed the domestic violence example - helping husbands find jobs was more efficient than years of victim based services.

Find the leverage points in the system where small interventions create outsized change. Don't try to address everything. Find where you can have the most impact with the least resource expenditure.

The Toast Ale example from the Core content demonstrates this well. They intervene at the food waste recovery point - turning surplus bread into beer. Direct waste reduction, immediate emissions avoided, and they fund environmental charities with the profits. Clean efficiency.

**Tag line:** **Find your leverage point.**

---

### Design for Your Capacity

**[MAIN PANEL: Systems map with complexity indicators]**

The Core Framework went deep on systems thinking and complexity science. Understanding the larger system, identifying leverage points, managing unintended consequences.

This is powerful work. It can also be resource-intensive.

Deep systems mapping takes time. Understanding complexity dynamics requires expertise. As a p2p venture you need to design for your capacity.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Systems work is deep | Design for capacity | Use what exists]**

You don't need to map the entire system yourself from scratch. Use existing research. Learn from organizations that have already done this work in your impact area.

The Core Framework emphasized this: copy from others. If someone has already figured out how the system works and where the intervention points are, use that knowledge.


**Tag line:** **Build on existing knowledge.**

---

### Partnership as a Strategy

**[MAIN PANEL: Partnership diagram showing load reduction]**

For 2p2 ventures, partnership is often the best strategy for efficient impact delivery.

This reduces the load on your business model dramatically.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Partner vs. build | Fund expansion | Reduce load]**

Partnership lets you focus on your core business model while still driving the impact you care about.

Maybe you partner with an organization that's already doing the work well. You fund their expansion into new areas or new populations. They deliver the impact activities. You handle your business model.

Or you partner with an organization that holds one piece of the solution while you hold another. Together you're more effective than either could be alone.

**Tag line:** **Partner to reduce load.**

### Example: Buy Me Once

**[MAIN PANEL: Buy Me Once canvas - Impact Model section]**

Let's look at Buy Me Once. They show how you can deliver meaningful impact without massive impact overhead on your business model.

Buy Me Once exists to reduce waste by helping consumers find products that last. Their purpose is environmental - combating throwaway culture and planned obsolescence.

They could have approached this with heavy impact activities. Running repair workshops. Creating educational campaigns. Lobbying manufacturers. All important work, but all resource-intensive.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Could have: Workshops | Campaigns | Lobbying | Resource-intensive]**

Instead, they chose an efficient intervention point: curation and platform.

They curate products that are genuinely durable and repairable. They create a marketplace where consumers can find these products easily. They provide information that helps people make better purchasing decisions.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Actually: Curate | Platform | Information | Efficient]**

**[MAIN PANEL: Show impact flow]**

Their impact happens through consumer choice, not through activities they directly run.

Each purchase through their platform is a purchase of a durable product instead of a disposable one. Each product review helps other consumers make informed choices. The cumulative effect drives demand for better-made goods and shifts market dynamics.

Their intervention point is elegant. They don't manufacture the products. They don't run the repair services. They don't operate the recycling programs. They connect consumers with products that last.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Don't make products | Don't run repairs | Connect consumers | Market shift]**

This creates real environmental impact - waste reduction, resource conservation, behavior change - without requiring them to deliver complex impact activities themselves.

The business model is sustainable at small scale. A lean team can run the platform, curate products, and maintain the community. The impact compounds as the platform grows, but the operational load stays manageable.

**[MAIN PANEL: Return to full Impact Model canvas]**

That's the efficiency lens in action. They found an intervention point that delivers impact without overwhelming the business model.

**Tag line:** **Efficient intervention point.**

### Use AI for Impact Research

**[MAIN PANEL: Research workflow diagram]**

Throughout the improvement process, use AI tools to accelerate your work.

Research existing impact models in your space. What approaches have others taken? What's proven to work? What assumptions have been validated?

Map stakeholders and intervention points. Who's already working on this issue? Where are the leverage points in the system?

Find partnership opportunities. Which organizations might be good partners for impact delivery?

Generate ideas for more efficient approaches you might not have considered.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Research models | Map stakeholders | Find partners | Generate ideas]**

AI won't replace decision-making based on lived experience and first hand experimentation. But it can dramatically accelerate the research and analysis that informs those decisions.

**Tag line:** **AI accelerates research.**

---

### Your Turn

**[MAIN PANEL: Impact Model section on blank canvas]**

Now follow the instructions in the core content on improving your impact model. 

But make sure you are taking do this in relation to the specific needs of your venture,  accounting for where you are on the purpose/impact spectrum and the scale that you are going for with your p2p venture.

Check the example libraries for ventures with similar impact goals. See how they structured their impact models for efficiency.

And document your assumptions about your impact model. You'll test these when you start validating.
