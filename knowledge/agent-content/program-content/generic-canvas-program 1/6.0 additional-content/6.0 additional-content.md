## Beyond Strategy
1. **Critical content for next release** 
	- Generic example library + sluglist
	- P2P example library + sluglist
	- P2P venture typology 

Add in the example library (and p2p example library in the treeview so that people can find it at any point in the program even when it's not being linked to in the content

2. **Important content for next release** (could be delayed but is necessary)
	- Venture stage model slug
	- Purpose slug
	- P2P - ways of building a p2p venture slug (actually incorporate this into the p2p content instead)
	- Customer Discovery (to connect with generic strategy/validation module )
	- Capital strategy module (to fit into strategy section)
		- Follow the akina capital strategy program for the basics on this. Types of investor/funders, types of legal structure etc

3. Follow-on content
	- Customers 
		- Conducting customer interviews [example](https://leanstack.com/ci/the-factory-nz/cohorts/start-up-301/guides/9gz60atwgkxx/content/dvp/demand-validation-playbook-b2aac420-93ec-4aaa-ab71-db132e3a9b84/part-1-problem-discovery/learn-problem-discovery/capturing-insights-c23e926c-9601-4ed4-bbfc-4b13d6223c6a) 
		- Finding customer - using AI and online tools to identify and reach potential customers
		- Building and using personas
	- Pitching - Rowan's magic structure + Made to stick
	- Venture type slug - mapping the different types of ventures that fit into the the canvas
	- Fundraising
	- Building Teams
	- Building brand - principles for early brand building 
	- Create a lean stack style step through from customer discovery to product development (this would only be if people really wanted it. I am trying to be broadly helpful and not super prescriptive. Like LS is doing specifically for startups)
