# The Improvement Process

<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 

Here's how to actually work through improving your customer model.

**First, gather input.** Talk with advisors, experts, and team members. Show them your canvas. Talk them through how your whole business model fits together, but focus in on your customer model. Gather feedback on where they think the weaknesses are and what improvements they'd suggest.

Use AI research tools to map your customer types and segments to predict whether they can provide the TAM and ARPU that your model needs. This gives you a high-level starting point.

Check the venture example library for ventures in similar spaces to yours. See how they found customer models that work.

**Second, work through systematically.** Work through your customer model in the same order you filled it in: Customers and Early Adopters, then Jobs to be Done and Existing Alternatives, then Unique Value Proposition, then Solution.

For each box, based on the ideas we've just talked through and feedback from advisors, brainstorm possible changes you could make. AI tools are really helpful here too. They can help you think broadly about different possibilities that you can then narrow in on.

**Third, test ripple effects.** For each idea you have that you think has potential, zoom out.

First, consider the rest of the customer model. How would these changes affect the flow of value creation? For example, if you changed the job to be done, would that require you to rethink the solution in order to serve that new customer need? Would it be MORE likely to get you to product-market fit?

Then, if it's looking positive, zoom out to your business model as a whole. What implications would this change have on your impact model and your economic model? What would have to change across your whole business model? Would this make your business model better as a whole?

Once you've done this, make a list of any high-potential ideas you've generated.

### Readiness Check

You're ready to move on when you can confidently answer these questions:

Can you clearly articulate your beachhead customer segment?

Does your TAM times ARPU show a path to sustainability?

Are you confident about the flow from customer segment to job to be done to unique value proposition to solution?

If yes, create a list of your core assumptions about this customer model. You'll need these when you start validating.

If you've discovered multiple compelling directions for your customer model, draft a separate Social Lean Canvas for each one. This gives you a stable place to work from as you develop your strategy.

Now let's move to your impact model.
