# Jobs to be Done

## Definition

**Jobs to be Done (JTBD)** is about understanding what's motivating your customers, what will drive them to engage with your solution, what job is your customer going to hire your product or service to do for them.

## Core Principles

### Go Deeper Than the Obvious

- Don't stop at surface-level needs that customers express
- Dig deep to find the particular thing you will be able to do for them 
- Identify how people might be currently getting these jobs done in existing alternatives
- Look for the underlying motivation, not just the functional requirement

### One Job Per Customer Type

- Identify at least one key job to be done for each customer type
- Color code or number each job to match your different customer types
- Different customer types will have different jobs to be done. Different customer segments of the same customer type will have the same (or very similar) jobs to be done
- Each job should correspond to a unique value proposition

## Why Jobs to be Done Matter

### Foundation for Value Creation

Understanding customer jobs is the basis for how your business model will create value. It's not about what you want to build, but what customers actually need accomplished. This is why you have to go deeper than the surface level. Someone buying a Rolex is not just trying to get the job of telling the time done. 

### Evidence of Market Need

Jobs to be Done connect directly to existing alternatives - if customers are already trying to get these jobs done (even poorly), it validates there's real demand.

### Competitive Differentiation

By understanding jobs deeply, you can identify gaps in how current solutions serve customers and find opportunities for differentiation.

## Implementation Approach

1. **Research each customer type** - What are they trying to achieve?
2. **Look beyond features** - Focus on outcomes and motivations
3. **Identify pain points** - What's frustrating about current solutions?
4. **Find the unmet need** - What can you do that others can't?
5. **Validate with customers** - Test your understanding with real people

## Common Pitfalls

- **Surface-level thinking**: "They need a better app" vs "They need to feel confident making decisions"
- **Feature focus**: Listing what your product does vs what job it accomplishes
- **One-size-fits-all**: Assuming all customer types have the same job
- **Internal perspective**: What you think they need vs what they actually need

## Examples 
**Facebook:**
- **Users** - University Students: Want to meet and connect with new people
- **Advertiser** - Want the ability to highly target potential customers increasing success rates and managing costs
