# The Improvement Process

Here's how to actually work through improving your impact model.

**First, gather input.** Talk with advisors, experts, and especially people with lived experience. Research organizations doing similar work. Use AI tools to fill gaps in your model. Review the example library for similar impact approaches.

**Second, work through systematically.** Follow your impact model canvas in order: Issue, then Participants, then Activities, then Short-term Outcomes, then Medium-term Outcomes, then Long-term Outcomes, then Impact.

For each box, based on the assessment lenses we just covered and the feedback you've gathered, brainstorm possible changes. Use AI to explore possibilities.

`[MAIN PANEL: Impact Model canvas with boxes highlighted in sequence]`

**Third, test ripple effects.** For each idea that looks promising, zoom out.

First, consider the impact model as a whole. Does this change strengthen the causal chain? Does it improve both micro and macro impact?

Then zoom out to your business model. How does this change affect your customer model? For example, different participants might mean different customers.

How does it affect your economic model? Different activities mean different costs. Partnership changes your cost structure.

Is the overall business model stronger with this change?

### Readiness Check

You're ready to move on when you can confidently answer these questions:

Can you articulate the causal chain with confidence - from activities through outcomes to impact?

Have you tested the logic with experts and people with lived experience?

Do you understand the larger system you're operating in?

Have you identified the most efficient intervention points?



`[VISUAL TEXT: confident logic | tested with experts | understand system | micro + macro]`

If yes, create a list of your core assumptions about this impact model. You'll need these when you start validating.

### Remember: You're Still Early

You're still in the early development of your business model. This doesn't have to be complete or perfect.

There will be lots more time to validate and evolve the impact model as you develop your venture. You'll learn things through testing that you can't know now.

But you want to make sure your impact model is good enough to start validating. There's no point in investing time and effort into testing something that just isn't good enough yet.

The goal is good enough to test, not perfect to launch.

Now let's move to your economic model.

Here's how to actually work through
improving your impact model.

00:00:03,687 --> 00:00:07,437
gather input, talk with
advisors, experts, and especially

people with lived experience.

00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:14,008
Research organizations doing similar work
Use AI tools to fill gaps in your model.

5
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:17,308
and review the example library
and look for ventures using

6
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:18,628
similar approaches to you.

00:00:19,512 --> 00:00:23,220
Second, work through systematically

In order issue.

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,100
Then partnerships, then activities,
then short term outcomes, medium term

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,050
outcomes, and long term outcomes.

11
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:32,349
And then final impact.

12
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:36,945
For each box based on the assessment
lenses we just covered and the

13
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:40,284
feedback that you've gathered,
brainstorm possible changes.

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,719
Use AI to explore possibilities.

15
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:45,386
Third, test ripple effects.

16
00:00:45,626 --> 00:00:49,127
For each idea that looks
promising, zoom out first.

Consider the impact model as a whole.

18
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:54,025
Does this change strengthen
the causal chain?

19
00:00:54,374 --> 00:00:56,890
Does it improve both
micro and macro impact?

20
00:00:57,484 --> 00:00:59,164
then zoom out to your business model.

21
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,611
How does this change
affect your customer model?

22
00:01:01,737 --> 00:01:04,897
For example, different participants
might mean different customers.

Different activities might mean different
costs,   Is the overall business

25
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:14,181
model stronger with this change?

26
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:18,311
You're ready to move on when you can
confidently answer these questions.

27
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,961
Can you articulate the causal chain
with confidence from activities

28
00:01:22,961 --> 00:01:24,701
through to outcomes to impact?

29
00:01:25,138 --> 00:01:28,978
Have you tested the logic with experts
and people with lived experience?

30
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:32,023
Do you understand the larger
system you are operating in?

31
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:35,491
Have you identified the most
efficient intervention points?

32
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:38,524
If yes, then create a list of
the core assumptions that you

33
00:01:38,524 --> 00:01:39,784
have in your impact model.

34
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:41,989
You'll need this when
you start validating.

35
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,646
You're still early in the
development of your business model.

36
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:47,926
This doesn't have to
be complete or perfect.

00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:52,319
There will be a lot more time to
validate and evolve the impact model.

38

There's no point in investing
time and effort into testing

42
00:02:04,063 --> 00:02:05,741
something that just isn't good.

43
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:08,881
