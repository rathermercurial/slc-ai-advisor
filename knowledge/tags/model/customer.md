The Customer Model describes how the enterprise creates value for its customers. This section helps entrepreneurs clearly define who they serve, what problems they solve, and how they deliver unique value.

## Purpose

The customer model ensures entrepreneurs deeply understand their target market before building solutions, reducing the risk of creating products nobody wants.
## Definition
The `customer-model` tag identifies content about the Customer Model section of the Social Lean Canvas - how enterprises create value for their customers through understanding customers, jobs to be done, solutions, and value propositions.

## Components

This folder contains the following customer model components:

### [Customers](customers/customers.md)
Individuals or organizations essential to the enterprise's operation, including customer types and segments.

### [Jobs to be Done](jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done.md)
The core tasks or needs motivating customers to engage with the solution.

### [Unique Value Proposition](unique-value-porposition/unique-value-proposition.md)
The distinct benefit provided to each customer type, directly addressing their specific jobs to be done.

### [Solution](solution/solution.md)
A simple, high-level description of the actual product or service that delivers customer value.
