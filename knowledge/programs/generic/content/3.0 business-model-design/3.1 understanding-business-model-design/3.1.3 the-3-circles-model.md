### The 3 Circles Model - Simplify to Succeed

As a founder, one of your key jobs is to decide what to prioritize and how MUCH you try to do right from the start?

There's a natural temptation to make your business model look impressive. Multiple customer segments. Different product offerings. Various revenue streams. More equals better, right? 

`[VISUAL TEXT: More complexity = More time + More risk]`

But there's a trap here: the more complex your business model is at the start, the more time and resources it will take to validate it. Complexity adds risk.

What makes a business model look good on paper often makes it impossible to validate in practice. You end up testing everything at once, getting conflicting signals from different customers wanting different things, and burning through your time and money.

For purpose-driven ventures, this is especially dangerous. You're already juggling both a customer model and an impact model. Adding unnecessary complexity on top of this is a recipe for failure.

You need a way to simplify and to focus on what actually matters for success.

### The Three Circles

The 3 Circles Model helps you strip away everything that doesn't need to be there right now.

`[MAIN PANEL: 3 circles diagram - Success (center), MVP (inner ring), Fantasy (outer)]`

It consists of, you guessed it, three circles: Success, MVP, and Fantasy.

The **Success circle** in the middle represents your core idea. The thing you think can work - that is, it can deliver your impact and your financial goals. This is what NEEDS to be true for your venture to succeed.

The **MVP circle** - which stands for Minimum Viable Product - is where you include your experiments and early versions of your product or service that will prove your Success model is viable. These are the tests that validate your core assumptions.

The **Fantasy circle** is for everything else. All those "nice to haves." Things that would be great to do but you don't NEED them for your to get to success. These ideas live here, and you'll revisit them once you've made your core model work. But you won't burn time, money, and effort validating them in the early stages.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Success = must work | MVP = prove it | Fantasy = later]`

Here's the key principle: only what's in your Success circle needs to be in your Social Lean Canvas right now. Everything else is distraction.

When you're validating, you're testing whether your Success circle works. Once it's working, you can expand. But not before.

### Facebook: A Case Study

Let's look at Facebook, they are not a purpose driven venture but how they developed in the early days makes them a good business model study.  

At the start, their Success circle was simple: become the largest social network on global university campuses. That's it. Not the everyone. Just university students.

Their MVP circle was even more focused: Harvard University first and then a few other American universities. This was to prove that for university students, their business model was right and could get to success.

`[MAIN PANEL: Facebook 3 circles diagram with examples in each]`

In their Fantasy circle you could put all the things they would eventually achieve. All the customer segments beyond students. Becoming an identity platform. A gaming platform. Launching digital currency. Building AI. All of that.

If they had added all of these to their Success circle, they never would have been able to build an MVP to test them. They would have burned up all their time and money getting conflicting signals from different customers wanting different things. And they would have failed.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Students first | Campus by campus | Everything else waited]`

Instead, they focused. Students. Campuses. One at a time. To prove it worked. Then they expand into what they are today.

That's how Facebook became Facebook. Not by doing everything at once, but by doing one thing well, validating it, then expanding.

### Apply This to Your Venture

Now apply this to your venture.

Look at your current business model ideas. Ask yourself three questions:

What's genuinely needed for success? What has to work for your venture to deliver impact and achieve financial sustainability? That goes in your Success circle.

What experiments will prove your Success circle works? That's your MVP circle.

Everything that can wait until after you've validated your core model? This goes in your Fantasy circle.

`[VISUAL TEXT: What must work? | What proves it? | What can wait?]`

Be honest with yourself. Most things can wait. That extra customer segment you think would be nice to serve? Fantasy circle. That additional feature that sounds cool? Fantasy circle. That secondary revenue stream? Unless you need it for your core success model to be viable, Fantasy circle.

When you're filling in your Social Lean Canvas, focus only on the components that live in your Success circle. Your MVP experiments become your validation strategy - we'll cover that in the Strategy module.

You don't need to fill out the 3 circles model, it is a thinking tool. It will help you decide what goes in your canvas and what experiments you will run in your validation strategy. 

But do make a list of your Fantasy ideas somewhere. Keep them safe. You'll come back to them. But don't let them distract you from validating what actually matters.

Remember: for purpose-driven ventures, you already have the complexity of integrating an impact model with a customer model and an economic model. Don't make it harder by adding unnecessary pieces.

Simplify. Focus. Validate your core. And then expand.

For purpose-driven ventures,
this is especially dangerous.

17
00:00:49,513 --> 00:00:53,683
You're already juggling a traditional

00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:58,016

It consists of, you guessed it, three
circles, success, MV, P, and fantasy.

23
00:01:15,656 --> 00:01:19,644
The success circle in the middle
represents your core idea, the

24
00:01:19,644 --> 00:01:20,889
thing that you think can work.

25
00:01:21,285 --> 00:01:24,711
That is, it can deliver your
impact and your financial goals.

26
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:28,615
This is what needs to be true
for your venture to succeed.

27
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:34,109
The MVP Circle, which stands for minimum
viable product is where you include

28
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:38,287
your experiments and early versions
of your product or service that will

29
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:40,292
prove that your success model is viable.

30
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:44,270
These are the tests that
validate your core assumptions.

31
00:01:44,962 --> 00:01:49,616
The fantasy circle is for everything
else, all those nice to haves, things

32
00:01:49,616 --> 00:01:53,394
that will be great, but you don't
need them for you to get to success.

33
00:01:53,772 --> 00:01:56,815
These ideas live here, and
you'll revisit them once you've

34
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:57,745
made your core model work.

35
00:01:58,332 --> 00:02:02,039
but you won't burn time, money, and
effort validating them in the early

36
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,064
stages because you don't need them.

37
00:02:04,816 --> 00:02:06,062
Here's the key principle.

38
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:06,512
Only.

39
00:02:06,512 --> 00:02:10,454
What's in your success circle needs to
be in your social lean canvas right now.

40
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:12,941
Everything else is distraction.

41
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:16,419
When you're validating your
testing, whether your success

42
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:20,592
circle works, once it's working,
you can expand, but not before.

43
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,577
Let's look at Facebook as an example.

44
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:26,950
They're not a purpose driven venture,
but how they developed in the early

45
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,930
days makes them a good case study.

46
00:02:29,744 --> 00:02:32,322
At the start, their
success circle was simple.

47
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:36,552
Become the largest social network
on global university campuses.

48
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:37,742
that, was it?

49
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:40,895
Not for everyone, just
for university students.

50
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:44,589
The MVP circle was even more focused.

51
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:48,664
Harvard University first, and then
a few other American universities.

52
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:52,805
This was to prove that for university
students, their business model was

53
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:57,720
right and could get to success  In
their fantasy circle, you could put all

54
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,358
the things that they would eventually
achieve, all the customer segments

55
00:03:01,358 --> 00:03:03,248
beyond students that they would reach.

56
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:06,448
Building an identity
platform, a gaming platform.

57
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:10,858
Launching a digital currency
building ai, VR glasses, all of that.

58
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,607
If they had added all of these into
their success circle, They never would've

59
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:18,007
been able to build an MVP to test them.

60
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:22,363
They would've burned up all their time
and money getting conflicting signals from

61
00:03:22,363 --> 00:03:25,732
different customers, wanting different
things, and they would've failed.

62
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:31,763
Instead, they focused on students
campuses one at a time to prove it worked.

63
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,000
and then expand into where they are today.

64
00:03:34,862 --> 00:03:36,630
That's how Facebook became Facebook.

65
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,530
Not by doing everything at once,
but by doing one thing well,

66
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,300
validating it, and then expanding.

67
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:44,549
Apply this to your venture.

68
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,646
Look at your current business model
and ask yourself three questions.

69
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:51,688
What's genuinely needed for success?

70
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:55,514
What has to work for this
venture to deliver impact and

71
00:03:55,514 --> 00:03:57,314
achieve financial sustainability?

72
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,631
That goes in your success.

73
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:02,140
Circle what experiments
will prove your success.

74
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,100
Circle works.

75
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:04,325
That's your MVP.

76
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:08,186
Circle, everything that can wait
until after you've validated your

77
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:10,287
core model that goes into fantasy.

78
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:12,410
Be honest with yourself.

79
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,700
Many things can wait.

80
00:04:14,048 --> 00:04:17,258
That extra customer segment you
think would be nice to serve.

81
00:04:17,438 --> 00:04:17,948
Fantasy.

82
00:04:17,948 --> 00:04:20,888
Circle that additional
feature that sounds cool.

83
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:21,638
Fantasy.

84
00:04:21,638 --> 00:04:26,183
Circle that secondary revenue stream
unless you need it for your core success

85
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,523
model to be viable fantasy circle.

86
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:32,554
When you're filling in your social
in canvas, focus only on the

87
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:34,324
components that live in your success.

88
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:38,322
Circle  your MVP experiments
become your validation strategy.

89
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:40,353
We'll cover that in the strategy module.

90
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:43,943
You don't need to fill out the
three circles model itself.

91
00:04:44,214 --> 00:04:45,324
It's a thinking tool.

92
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:48,987
It will help you decide what goes
in your canvas and what experiments

93
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:51,087
you'll run in your validation strategy.

94
00:04:51,622 --> 00:04:54,226
But do make a list of your
fantasy ideas somewhere.

95
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:55,156
Keep them safe.

96
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:56,176
You'll come back to them.

97
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:59,857
Don't let them distract you from
validating what actually matters.

98
00:05:00,378 --> 00:05:04,724
Remember, for purpose-driven ventures,
you already have the complexity of

99
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:08,410
integrating impact with a customer
model and an economic model.

100
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,359
Don't make it harder by
adding unnecessary pieces.

101
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:15,391
Simplify, focus, validate
your core, then expand.
