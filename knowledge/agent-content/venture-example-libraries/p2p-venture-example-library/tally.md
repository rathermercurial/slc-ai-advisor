## **Why it’s a strong solo-preneur case**

- **Small-by-design:** Shows how a **tiny, bootstrapped team** can compound with a narrow, well-designed product and public build ethos. 
    
- **Free-first → light conversion → recurring:** The **badge loop** + unlimited free tier lowers friction; conversion is modest but predictable (the “2% rule”). 
    
- **Purpose fit:** Independence, customer-funded growth, EU privacy posture = credible **“honest hustle”** story without hype.
