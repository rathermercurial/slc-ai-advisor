## P2P FRAMING

**[MAIN PANEL: Impact Model sections on canvas]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
Now you are going to work through the Core content on Impact Model. This shows how your activities generate positive social or environmental outcomes that create long-term impact.

The Core Framework walks through rigorous impact modeling—issue, participants, activities, outcomes at different time horizons, and ultimate impact. This is the full framework used by social enterprises.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Issue | Participants | Activities | Outcomes | Impact]**

Remember the spectrum we talked about in the Purpose section. You might be building a full impact driven venture with a detailed impact model. Or your purpose might be more personal. After the Core content, we'll show what impact modeling looks like across that full spectrum.

**Tag line:** **Impact at every level.**

## P2P COMMENTARY


<span style="color:green"> p2p 3.2.3 impact-model 2.webm.02.mp4.webm</span> 


**[MAIN PANEL: Spectrum graphic from Purpose section]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just showed you how to build rigorous impact models for social and environmental change. Now let's talk about what this means across the P2P spectrum.

**Tag line:** **Your impact, your way.**

---

### Impact Model as Operationalizing Purpose

**[MAIN PANEL: Purpose box → Impact Model flow]**

Your impact model is how you operationalize your purpose. It captures the logic of how your intentions translate into actual change in the world.

If you're pursuing explicit social or environmental impact, you map it using the framework you just saw—issue through to impact. This gets you beyond hopes and assumptions about positive change. You map the causal chain so you can measure whether it's actually happening.

But if you're not pursuing that kind of impact, you can still use the impact model structure to map your personal journey. What you're trying to achieve, for yourself and the people close to you.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Social impact OR Personal transformation | Both valid]**

Let's look at both.

**Tag line:** **Map your change.**

### Example: Ridwell (Social/Environmental Impact)

**[MAIN PANEL: Ridwell Impact Model diagram]**

**Script (spoken):**

Ridwell likely has an impact model that looks something like this - 

**Issue**: Hard-to-recycle household items are filling landfills because of system gaps and inconvenient disposal options.

**Participants**: Household members, Ridwell staff, recycling and reuse partners, broader communities.

**Activities**: Households sort items, Ridwell does bi-weekly doorstep collection, warehouse processing, transportation to specialized partners.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Issue → Participants → Activities → Outcomes]**

**Short-term outcomes**: Items diverted from trash, reduced disposal guilt, increased recycling awareness.

**Medium-term outcomes**: Millions of pounds diverted, expanded partner networks, normalized subscription waste services.

**Long-term outcomes**: Systemic waste reduction, stronger circular economy, policy changes supporting environmental responsibility.

**Impact**: A future where responsible disposal is as convenient as trash, supporting a circular economy with minimal waste.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Causal chain from activities to impact]**

You can see the causal chain—activities lead to measurable short-term changes, which compound into medium-term shifts, which create long-term systemic change, which moves toward the ultimate impact.

**Tag line:** **Map the causal chain.**

### Example: Personal Transformation

**[MAIN PANEL: Personal Impact Model diagram]**

**Script (spoken):**

Now, if your purpose isn't about solving a social or environmental problem? What if it's just focused on creating a better future for yourself and your family?

You can still use the impact model structure. It could look something like this:

**Issue**: Feeling trapped in work that doesn't align with your values. Wanting to create freedom and a better life for your family.

**Participants**: You, your family, maybe close collaborators.

**Activities**: Building this Purpose Pivot Venture—creating the business model, validating it, launching it, making it succeed. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Personal issue → Your activities → Your outcomes]**

**Short-term outcomes**: You're out of your suffocating job, You're making progress on the venture. You feel more aligned with your values. You're building new skills.

**Medium-term outcomes**: The venture is generating income. You have more control over your time. Your family sees the change.

**Long-term outcomes**: You've achieved financial independence. You're doing work that matters to you. You've created the freedom you wanted.

**Impact**: You're living a life aligned with your values, with the freedom to choose how you spend your time and the resources to support the people around you.

**[VISUAL TEXT: From trapped to free | From misaligned to purposeful]**

This is a valid use of the impact model. You're mapping how your activities create the change you're seeking—even if that change is personal rather than societal.

**Tag line:** **Personal change counts.**

---

### Design is Never Neutral (Callback)

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Design is Never Neutral"]**

**Script (spoken):**

Remember Design is Never Neutral from the Purpose section? This personal transformation example shows why it matters.

Even if your impact model is "create freedom for myself and my family," you're still encoding values. What kind of freedom? At what cost? With what constraints? How do you want to be in the world as you build this?

**[VISUAL TEXT: Personal impact still encodes values]**

Without being explicit about these things, defaults and incentives will work against them. You could end up with financial success but burned relationships. Or freedom from a job but trapped in a venture that's just as miserable.

Map your personal impact deliberately. It keeps you honest about what you're actually trying to achieve.

**Tag line:** **Encode your values.**

---

### Both Personal and Social

**[MAIN PANEL: Buy Me Once example]**

**Script (spoken):**

Some Purpose Pivot Ventures probably have both—personal transformation and social or environmental impact layered together.

Buy Me Once likely fits this pattern. Building a sustainable business that creates freedom and income, while also creating environmental impact through promoting durable, sustainable products.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Personal + Social | Both valid]**

You don't have to choose one or the other. Just be clear about what you're mapping and why.

**Tag line:** **Impact can layer.**

---

### Practical Guidance

**[MAIN PANEL: Impact Model sections on canvas]**

**Script (spoken):**

Keep it simple on your first pass. Whether you're mapping social impact or personal transformation, just get the basic flow down.

If your impact model is complex—multiple participant groups, multiple causal chains—it'll take more time to develop. That's fine. But make sure you're not adding complexity you don't need. Focus on the impact components that truly align with your purpose.

Check out the P2P Example Library to see different approaches. The Core Example Library has comprehensive social enterprise impact models if you want to go deep.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Simple first | Focus on purpose | Use examples]**

Document your impact model. Capture it in your canvas. This becomes the logic by which you'll prove—to yourself, to funders, to collaborators—that the change you're seeking is actually happening.
