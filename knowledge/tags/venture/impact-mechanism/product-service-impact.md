# product-service-impact

## Definition
The `product-service-impact` tag identifies ventures where social or environmental impact is embedded directly in the core product or service offering. The act of purchasing or using the product/service creates the beneficial impact.

## Usage Criteria
Apply this tag to ventures where:
- Impact is inherent in the product or service itself
- Customers create positive change through normal usage
- The core offering directly addresses a social or environmental problem
- Impact scales automatically with sales/usage volume
- No additional programs needed to generate impact

## Always Include When
- Products that directly solve social/environmental problems
- Services that inherently create positive impact
- Technology solutions with built-in beneficial outcomes
- Consumer goods that replace harmful alternatives
- Business models where usage equals impact

## Never Include When
- Separate impact programs alongside commercial activities
- Profit donation or reinvestment models (use `reinvest-surplus`)
- Employment-focused impact (use `employment-model`)
- Service delivery separate from core offering (use `direct-service`)

## Required Combinations
- Must include `venture-type` and `impact-mechanism`
- Often combined with `product-sales` or `service-fees` revenue tags
- Frequently paired with specific industry tags

## Content Examples
