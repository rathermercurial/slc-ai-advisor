# Strategic Improvement Levers

These are organized by what aspect of the customer model you're changing: WHO you're serving, WHO PAYS for it, or WHAT VALUE you're delivering.

### WHO - Market and Segment Scope

First, the beachhead strategy.

Remember the three circles model? You're looking for the core customer segment that you can serve to get the venture to success. Don't just list anyone who might buy your product.

Narrow in on a niche of people who will absolutely buy your product, for a good price, and that's big enough to get you to success. You can expand out into adjacent customer segments when you're already succeeding.

`[VISUAL TEXT: narrow focus | absolute buyers | big enough to win]`

If your early adopters represent a large enough TAM to get you to success, focus on them as your beachhead customer segment. But if they're not going to be enough, you'll have to broaden your beachhead TAM to include members of your early majority.


Now, three ways to adjust your market and segment scope:

**Broaden.** If your customer segment is too small, can you broaden to include a larger segment with the same compelling proposition?

**Narrow.** Is your customer segment specific enough? Don't be afraid to narrow in on a very niche customer segment that has a stronger and easier to articulate version of the problem you're going to solve.

**Look to adjacent segments.** Could a nearby segment have a stronger job to be done, fewer alternatives, or more ability to pay?

### WHO PAYS - User, Buyer, Funder

Second strategic lever: who's actually paying?

**Follow the money.** Don't be afraid to give up on a customer segment that wants your product, in favor of one that will pay more - assuming this doesn't invalidate your impact model, of course.

You're better off having a smaller market of highly motivated customers who will pay more. This is especially true at the beginning.

Your early adopters don't just want your product - they NEED your product. Make sure you aren't just selling an okay thing to a vanilla market. Sell an amazing thing to a well-defined market. That's product-market fit.

`[VISUAL TEXT: amazing thing | well-defined market | product-market fit]`

**Rethink your customer types**If your model has multiple customer types, can they be reworked and recombined in a more powerful way?

Perhaps the user can't pay enough to sustain the model, but someone else will pay. With a social enterprise, the user may benefit but not pay much. But there could be a government buyer of outcomes who will pay. Or a sponsor who'd love to be associated with the work and would subsidize the user.

Or perhaps there could be two user types: a standard user who pays a discounted price and a premium user who funds the standard users' access to the product or service.

### WHAT VALUE - Job and Value Framing

Third strategic lever: how you're framing the value.

**Category reframing.** Think through the job to be done. Is this the highest value job for this customer?

If you go deeper into the psychology of the customer, you might discover there's a deeper need underneath the need you think you're serving. Luxury brands know this well. They're not serving a functional need - they're serving a status need.

Understanding that your product can serve deep psychological needs for your customers can completely reframe your value proposition, the value the customer perceives, and what they'll pay for it.

You could **Find an acute need.** Is there another customer segment that you could do a much higher value job with the same solution? One person's nice-to-have could be another's must-have.

For example, a few years ago a law was passed in my home country or Aotearoa/New Zealand that made directors of companies criminally liable for workplace safety failures. If someone dies at the workplace, a company director could go to jail for it.

If you were a venture selling safety audits globally, you could pivot into the New Zealand market and find a whole market of customers with an urgent new must-have need.

`[VISUAL TEXT: nice-to-have → must-have | new regulation = urgent need]`

You could try **Workflow repositioning.** Move upstream or downstream to find a place to play where your value is clearer.

For example, rather than offering advisory services for buildings to assess accessibility for people with disabilities, you move upstream and sell design audits in partnership with architects.

Rather than being the organization that points out how bad things are, this positions you where the value you contribute can be integrated into building designs. The builder gets credit for partnering with a disabilities organization. This allows you to charge more AND your recommendations will actually lead to better accessibility outcomes.

You can work on **Solution improvement.** Improving the value your solution delivers is one of the key levers of your business model. If the rest of your customer model is correct, your solution is how the value you promise gets delivered.

If you can find meaningful improvements, you can improve ARPU by increasing the price you can charge. Or improve ARPU by decreasing the churn rate - the rate at which customers stop using and paying for your product or service. Or create cost reductions through making delivery of your business model more efficient.

It's important to recognize that getting people to switch from their existing alternative to your product requires your solution to be significantly better than their current solution. So if what you currently have in your solution box is not either significantly better or significantly cheaper than the existing alternatives, then you should invest time to improve it.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,829
The strategic improvement levers
are organized around what aspect of

2
00:00:04,829 --> 00:00:06,629
the customer model you're changing.

3
00:00:07,212 --> 00:00:10,962
Who you're serving, who pays for
it, or what value you're delivering.

4
00:00:11,564 --> 00:00:13,186
First, the beachhead strategy.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,468
Remember the three circles model You're
looking for the core customer segment you

6
00:00:17,468 --> 00:00:19,838
can serve to get your venture to success.

7
00:00:20,284 --> 00:00:23,130
Don't just list anyone who
might buy your product.

8
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:26,268
Narrow in on a niche of people
who will absolutely buy your

9
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:29,679
product for a good price that's
big enough to get you to success.

10
00:00:30,184 --> 00:00:33,541
You can expand out into other
adjacent customer segments

11
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,011
once you're already succeeding.

12
00:00:35,676 --> 00:00:40,007
If your early adopters represent a
large enough TAM to get you to success.

13
00:00:40,344 --> 00:00:43,314
Focus on them as your
beachhead customer segment.

14
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:48,051
But if they're not gonna be enough, you'll
have to broaden your beachhead tam to

15
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:50,631
include members of your early majority.

16
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:54,325
Now, three ways to think
about adjusting your customer

17
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:55,765
segments if they're not right.

18
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:57,039
Okay,  broaden.

19
00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:00,744
If your customer segment is
too small,  Can you broaden to

20
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:04,201
include a larger segment with
the same compelling proposition?

21
00:01:04,758 --> 00:01:07,595
Narrow is your customer
segment specific enough?

22
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:12,320
Don't be afraid to narrow in on a very
niche customer segment that has a stronger

23
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,070
and easier to articulate version of
the problem that you're going to solve.

24
00:01:16,697 --> 00:01:18,432
Look to adjacent segments.

25
00:01:18,517 --> 00:01:21,806
Could a nearby segment have
a stronger job to be done?

26
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:24,782
Fewer alternatives or more ability to pay.

27
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:30,264
The second strategic lever who's
actually paying  follow the money.

28
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,194
Don't be afraid to give up on a
customer segment that wants your product

29
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:38,266
assuming this doesn't invalidate your
impact model, of  You're better off

30
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:42,106
having a smaller market of highly
motivated customers who will pay more.

31
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:44,382
This is especially true in the beginning.

32
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:47,038
Your early adopters don't
just want your product.

33
00:01:47,068 --> 00:01:48,358
They need your product.

34
00:01:48,563 --> 00:01:52,401
Make sure you aren't just selling
an okay thing to a vanilla market.

35
00:01:52,763 --> 00:01:57,220
Sell an amazing thing to a well-defined
market that's product market fit.

36
00:01:58,317 --> 00:01:59,877
Rethink your customer types.

37
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:04,197
If your model has multiple customer
types, can they be reworked and

38
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:06,027
recombined in a more powerful way?

39
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:10,569
Perhaps the user can't pay enough to
sustain the model, but someone else

40
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:15,653
will pay With a social enterprise, the
user may benefit but not pay much,  But

41
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:19,423
there could be a government buyer of
outcomes who will pay,  or a sponsor

42
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:22,873
who'd love to be associated with the
work and would subsidize the user.

43
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:25,697
Or perhaps there could be two user types.

44
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:29,147
A standard user who pays a
discounted price and a premium

45
00:02:29,147 --> 00:02:32,864
user who funds the standard user's
access to the product or service.

46
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:37,918
Third, strategic lever, how
you're framing the value, Think

47
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:39,058
through the job to be done.

48
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:41,763
Is this the highest value
job for the customer?

49
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:45,702
If you go deep into the psychology of
the customer,  You might discover that

50
00:02:45,702 --> 00:02:48,807
there's a deeper need underneath the
need that you think you're serving.

51
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:51,178
Luxury brands know this well.

52
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:53,267
They're not serving a functional need.

53
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:54,827
They're serving a status need.

54
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:58,363
Understanding that your product
can serve deep psychological needs

55
00:02:58,368 --> 00:03:01,781
for your customer can completely
reframe your value proposition,

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,359
the value the customer perceives
and what they're prepared to pay.

57
00:03:05,898 --> 00:03:07,334
You could find an acute need.

58
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:10,614
Is there another customer segment
that you could do a much higher

59
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:12,954
value job for with the same solution?

60
00:03:13,524 --> 00:03:16,584
One person's nice to have,
could be another's, must have.

61
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:20,347
For example, a few years ago, a
law was passed in my home country,

62
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:24,450
ERO in New Zealand, it made all
directors of companies criminally

63
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,820
liable for workplace safety failures.

64
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:31,304
If someone dies at a workplace, a
company director could go to jail for it.

65
00:03:31,771 --> 00:03:35,355
If you were a venture selling safety
audits globally,  You could pivot

66
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:38,565
into the New Zealand market and
find a whole market of customers

67
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:41,068
with an urgent new must have need.

68
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:46,938
You could try workflow repositioning,
Move upstream or downstream to find a

69
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:48,933
place to play where your value is clearer.

70
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:53,593
For example, rather than offering
advisory services for buildings

71
00:03:53,593 --> 00:03:57,450
to assess accessibility for
people with disabilities, you move

72
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,394
upstream and sell design audits
in partnership with architects.

73
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,056
rather than being the organization
that points out how bad things

74
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:08,713
are, This positions you where the
value you can contribute can be

75
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:10,633
integrated into building designs.

76
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:14,400
The builder gets credit for partnering
with a disabilities organization.

77
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:18,828
This allows you to charge more and
your recommendations actually lead

78
00:04:18,828 --> 00:04:20,568
to better accessibility outcomes.

79
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:24,784
You can work on solution
improvement, Improving the value

80
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:28,144
of your solution is one of the
key levers of your business model.

81
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:32,401
If the rest of your customer model
is correct, your solution is how the

82
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:34,256
value you promise gets delivered.

83
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:37,737
If you can find meaningful
improvements, you could improve

84
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:39,477
ARPU by increasing the price.

85
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:44,515
You can charge  or conversely improve ARPU
by decreasing the churn rate, the rate at

86
00:04:44,515 --> 00:04:49,102
which customers stop using and paying for
your product or service, or create cost

87
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:52,107
reductions through making the delivery
of your business model more efficient.

88
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:57,004
It's important to recognize that getting
people to switch from their existing

89
00:04:57,004 --> 00:05:01,471
alternative to your product requires
your solution to be significantly better

90
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:03,301
than their current available solution.

91
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:08,074
So if what you currently have in your
solution box is not either significantly

92
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:12,454
better or significantly cheaper
than existing alternatives, then you

93
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:14,314
should invest time in improving it.
