# Generic/Core Program

The Generic (Core) program is the foundational Social Lean Canvas learning journey designed for a broad social entrepreneur audience. It provides comprehensive set of guided steps for building purpose-driven ventures that combine business models with impact models.

## Program Overview

The Generic program serves ventures across all sectors, stages, and legal structures. It provides a step by step process to guide users to:

- Design business models that create both financial sustainability and measurable social/environmental impact
- Map these ventures using the 11-section Social Lean Canvas framework
- Systematically improve and validate their business models
- Develop executable strategies for building successful purpose-driven ventures

**Target Audience:** Social enterprises, community ventures, cooperatives, nonprofits with earned income, mission-led startups, solo ventures, and other purpose-driven organizations.

**Program Structure:** Two distinct sub-programs that can be delivered together or separately:

| Sub-Program                | Modules | Purpose                          | Outcome                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Social Lean Canvas** | 2.0-3.2 | Create first draft canvas        | Complete 11-section canvas mapping venture        |
| **Build**                  | 4.0-5.3 | Improve model & develop strategy | Strengthened business model + executable strategy |

## Two-Part Program Structure

### 1. The Social Lean Canvas (Modules 2.0-3.2)

**Learning Objective:** Guide entrepreneurs through creating a complete first-draft Social Lean Canvas that maps their entire venture on one page.

**Content Coverage:**

- **Module 2.0 - Introduction:** Program orientation, understanding purpose-driven ventures
- **Module 3.0 - Business Model Design:**
  - **3.1 - Understanding Business Model Design:** Business model fundamentals, the 3-circles model, venture examples
  - **3.2 - Fill In Your Canvas:** Step-by-step guidance for completing all 11 canvas sections

**The 11 Canvas Sections:**

1. **Purpose** - The venture's mission and reason for existing
2. **Customers** - Target customer segments - includes **early adopters** sub heading for who the first customers will be
3. **Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)** - Customer needs being served - includes **existing alternatives** sub heading for how customers are currently getting their jobs done
4. **Unique Value Proposition (UVP)** - The benefit - why customers choose this solution
5. **Solution** - The product/service delivered
6. **Impact** - Theory of change and measurable outcomes - breaks into 7 steps **1. Issue, 2. Participants, 3. Activities, 4. Short-term outcomes, 5. Medium-term outcomes, 6. Long-term outcomes, 7. Impact**
7. **Channels** - How customers find and receive the solution
8. **Revenue** - Money sources and revenue model
9. **Costs** - Resources required to deliver solution and impact
10. **Advantage** - Sustainable competitive advantage
11. **Key Metrics** - Critical success measures

**Canvas models**
For teaching purposes the 11 canvas sections are grouped into 3 main models

1. **Customer Model** - Customers, JTBD, UVP & Solution
2. **Impact Model** - Issue, Participants, Activities, Short-term outcomes, Medium-term outcomes, Long-term outcomes, Impact
3. **Economic Model** - Channels, Revenue, Costs, Advantage
4. Note - Purpose & Key Metrics are independent of these three models

**Pedagogical Approach:** Video-guided instruction walking entrepreneurs through each concept and canvas section, supported by venture examples from the example library.

### 2. Build (Modules 4.0-5.3)

**Learning Objective:** Transform a completed first-draft canvas into a strengthened business model with an executable strategy to validate and build it.

**Content Coverage:**

#### Module 4.0 - Improving Your Business Model

Systematic improvement of the three core models through assessment, lever exploration, and iteration:

- **4.1 - Introduction:** Overview of improvement process
- **4.2 - Improving Customer Model:** Assess customer segments, JTBD, UVP, and solution; explore improvement levers, iterate your model, capture assumptions
- **4.3 - Improving Impact Model:** Assess theory of change, improvement levers, iterate your model, capture assumptions
- **4.4 - Improving Economic Model:** Assess economics, improvement levers, iterate your model, capture assumptions
- **4.5 - Conclusion:** Integration and next steps

#### Module 5.0 - Developing Your Strategy

Turn improved business model into executable validation and development strategy:

- **5.1 - Designing Your Strategy:**
  - Assess venture stage (idea, early, growth, scale)
  - Understand validation principles
  - Create validation plans for Customer, Impact, and Economic models
- **5.2 - Building Your Strategy:**
  - Integrate validation plans into coherent timeline
  - Map business model strategy, organizational strategy, and capital strategy
  - Create executable roadmap for immediate, short-term, and medium-term horizons

**Note:** Build can be delivered as a continuation of The Social Lean Canvas program or sold separately as a follow-on program for entrepreneurs who have already completed their canvas.

## The Three Models Framework

The Social Lean Canvas organizes ventures into three interconnected models:

### 1. Customer Model

**Canvas Sections:** Customers, Jobs To Be Done, Unique Value Proposition, Solution

**Model Purpose:** Maps how the venture creates value for customers - who they serve, what needs they address, why customers choose this solution, and what's delivered.

**Complexity Range:**

- Simple: One product, one customer type
- Complex: Multiple customer types (users vs. payers vs. partners)
- Very Complex: Multi-sided platforms with distinct roles

### 2. Impact Model

**Canvas Sections:** Impact (7-field causality chain)

**Model Purpose:** Theory of change showing how venture activities lead to measurable social/environmental outcomes over time.

**Components:** Issue → Participants → Activities → Short-term Outcomes → Medium-term Outcomes → Long-term Outcomes → Impact

### 3. Economic Model

**Canvas Sections:** Channels, Revenue, Costs, Advantage

**Model Purpose:** Maps how money flows through the venture - customer acquisition/delivery channels, revenue sources, cost structure, and sustainable competitive advantage.

**These three models plus Purpose and Key Metrics constitute the complete 11-section Social Lean Canvas.**

---
# Module Content

[Educational script content with video references...]
```

### File Naming Convention

Pattern: `[Module.Number] [descriptive-kebab-case-title].md`

Examples:

- `2.0 intro.md`
- `3.1 understanding-business-model-design.md`
- `3.2.1 purpose.md`
- `4.2.3 improvement-levers.md`
- `5.1.4 customer-model-validation.md`

### Content Types

- **video-content:** Video script with spoken narration and visual direction
- **program-content:** General program educational material e.g the example library
- Module-specific tags: `business-model-design`, `improving`, `strategy`

## Using This README

### For the AI Advisor

**Content Navigation:**

- Use module numbers to locate specific content (e.g., "3.2.2" for customer model section)
- Filter by tags to find canvas-section-specific content
- Distinguish between Canvas program (2.0-3.2) and Build program (4.0-5.3)
- Reference venture examples from `examples/` to illustrate concepts, determine relevance based on matching tags and concepts

**User Guidance:**

- Route users to Canvas program (2.0-3.2) when creating first draft
- Route users to Build program (4.0-5.3) when improving existing canvas or developing strategy

**Content Hierarchy:**

- Top-level module files (e.g., `3.0`, `4.0`) provide overviews
- Sub-modules dive into specific topics
- Use nested structure to find detailed content (up to 4 levels deep)

### For Human Maintainers

**Adding Content:**

- Place new canvas-creation content in `3.0 business-model-design/`
- Place improvement content in `4.0 improving-your-business-model/`
- Place strategy content in `5.0 developing-your-strategy/`
- Follow module numbering hierarchy (X.0 → X.Y → X.Y.Z → X.Y.Z.N)

**Tagging Strategy:**

- TBD

## Known Issues

**Orphaned Content:**

- `4-build/4-build.md` folder appears orphaned - unclear relationship to `4.0 improving-your-business-model/`
- May represent legacy naming or alternate entry point

**Directory Depth:**

- Some modules nest 4 levels deep (e.g., `4.4.3.1 types-of-leverage.md`)
- Deep nesting can make navigation complex
