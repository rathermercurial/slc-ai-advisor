**Tag line: "From validation to execution"**

### Bringing It All Together

You've done the hard work. You've created validation plans for your customer model, your impact model, and your economic model. You know what assumptions need testing and how you'll test them.

Now you need to bring all of this together into one coherent strategy that you can actually execute.

`[MAIN PANEL: The three validation plans side by side]`

That's what a strategy model does. It takes your validation plans and turns them into an execution roadmap. It shows what happens when, in what order, and what you need to make it possible.


### What Is a Strategy Model?

Your strategy model has three layers that work together.

`[MAIN PANEL: Strategy model template showing three layers]`

**The Business Model Layer** - Your validation experiments and execution activities. This is what you're doing to test and build your business model. Your validation plans from the last three sections become this layer.

**The Organizational Layer** - What needs to happen organizationally to make your business model strategy possible. Team, structure, partnerships, assets.

**The Capital Layer** - Where funding enters to enable your organizational and business model strategies. When you need it, how much, from whom.

These three layers interact and influence each other. They're not built separately - they work as a system. 
 

And they're laid out across a timeline: two months, six months, eighteen months.

### The 2/6/18 Month Timeline

This timeline structure gives you the right balance between planning and flexibility.

**Two months** - This is your detailed, committed plan. You know exactly what you're doing, who's doing it, what resources you need. This is tight and specific.

**Six months** - This is your likely next steps if your two-month experiments go according to plan. Still specific enough to be useful, but with the knowledge that you'll learn things in the first two months that might change this.

**Eighteen months** - This is your longer arc. Where you're heading if things continue to progress. You know this will change, but it gives you direction and helps you see inflection points.

This structure lets you be thoughtful and strategic while staying flexible and adaptive to new learning.

As you move from idea and early stage through to growth and scale stages you will stretch out your timeline to reflect the longer-term planning that you need to do as you transition from experimentation to execution. But the 2. 6. and 18 month model is an ideal balance of structure and flexibility for early stage ventures.
