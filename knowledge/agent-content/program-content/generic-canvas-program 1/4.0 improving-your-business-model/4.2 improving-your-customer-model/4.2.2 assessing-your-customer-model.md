# Assess Your Customer Model

Now let's assess whether your customer model is strong enough. Fundamentally you are asking 2 question: 
1. Do I have the right product, to deliver the right value proposition, to get the job done for my customer segment? Ie will my customers engage and pay for my solution?
2. And second is my customer segment large enough and will they each pay enough to make the business model work?

You are going to validate question by engaging with real customers in the strategy module up next. But before doing this, you need to have some of question 2 and be confident, at least on paper, your customer model could work. 

We can frame this up using 2 simple concepts - TAM and ARPU.

**TAM** - Total Addressable Market - is the total number of customers inside a tightly defined customer segment. Individual customers, with your specific job to be done, inside a single geography or channel.

Use available data and AI tools to help you calculate the TAM for your customer segments. This gives you a ballpark on how many customers you can potentially serve.

`[VISUAL TEXT: TAM = total customers in defined segment]`

**ARPU** - Average Revenue Per User - is what a particular customer in your customer segment is likely to pay for your product or service. That is the average total revenue you are likely to get per customer usually calculated on a monthly basis.  

Again, use available data and AI tools to create this estimate.

`[VISUAL TEXT: ARPU = spending power | need strength | perceived value | alternatives]`

These two calculations - while still ballpark figures - give you more detail than the back of the napkin numbers you might have used for your first pass through the canvas.

**TAM times ARPU equals your revenue potential.**

`[VISUAL TEXT: TAM × ARPU = revenue potential]`

This lets you compare customer segments and get a sense of whether they could provide enough revenue to make the business model work.

Assess whether your customer model looks like it can work
### Common Weaknesses to Look For

As you assess, watch for these commone issues:

Your segment is too small for your unit economics to work.

Your ARPU is too low to reach breakeven at a realistic scale.

Your early adopters don't actually signal a bigger market.

Or if you have multiple customer types, they're not working together in an integrated way.

If your customer model doesn't look good enough to get you to product-market fit, you need to fix it now. If you push forward with a weak model, you'll find it increasingly hard to change and improve it later.

Here are the strategic levers you can pull to improve it.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's assess whether your
customer model is strong enough.

2
00:00:03,329 --> 00:00:05,039
Fundamentally, you're
asking two questions.

3
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:09,362
Do I have the right product to
deliver the right value proposition

4
00:00:09,392 --> 00:00:11,432
to get the job done for my customer?

5
00:00:11,856 --> 00:00:14,676
IE will my customers
engage with my solution?

6
00:00:15,194 --> 00:00:18,186
And secondly, is my customer
segment large enough?

7
00:00:18,276 --> 00:00:21,006
And will they each pay enough
to make the business model work?

8
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:25,553
You're gonna validate these questions
by engaging with real customers in

9
00:00:25,553 --> 00:00:30,172
the strategy module up next,   but
before this, you need to at least

10
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:33,356
have confidence on paper that
your customer model could work.

11
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:38,119
We can frame this up using two
simple concepts, TAM and arpu.

12
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:38,957
Tam.

13
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:42,857
Total addressable market is the
number of customers inside a

14
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:44,717
tightly defined customer segment.

15
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:49,057
Individual customers with your
specific job to be done inside

16
00:00:49,057 --> 00:00:50,857
a single geography or channel.

17
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,684
Use available data and AI tools
to help you calculate the TAM

18
00:00:55,684 --> 00:00:56,884
for your customer segment.

19
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:01,129
This gives you a ballpark on how many
customers you can potentially serve.

20
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:02,552
Arpu.

21
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:06,105
Average revenue per user is what
a particular customer in your

22
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:09,705
customer segment is likely to
pay for your product or service.

23
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:14,298
It's the average total revenue you're
likely to get per customer, usually

24
00:01:14,298 --> 00:01:16,398
calculated on a monthly basis.

25
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:20,905
Again, use available data and AI
tools to create this estimate.

26
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:25,513
These two calculations while still
ballpark figures give you more

27
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:28,901
detail than the back of the napkin
numbers that you might have used for

28
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:30,671
your first pass through the canvas.

29
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:33,788
Tam times ARPU equals
your revenue potential.

30
00:01:34,513 --> 00:01:37,495
This lets you compare customer
segments and get a sense of whether

31
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:40,786
they could provide enough revenue
to make your business model work.

32
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:43,941
assist whether your customer
model looks like it can work.

33
00:01:44,743 --> 00:01:47,383
As you assess, watch
for these common issues.

34
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:51,094
Your segment is too small for
your unit economics to work.

35
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:55,161
Your ARPU is too low to reach
breakeven at a realistic scale.

36
00:01:56,471 --> 00:02:01,078
Your early adopters don't actually
signal a bigger market, Or if you have

37
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,008
multiple customer types, they're not
working together in an integrated way.

38
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:08,881
if your customer model doesn't look
good enough for you to get to product

39
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:11,311
market fit, you need to fix it now.

40
00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:15,044
If you push forward with a weak
model, you'll find it increasingly

41
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:16,964
hard to change and improve it later.

42
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:20,552
are the strategic levers
you can pull to improve it.
