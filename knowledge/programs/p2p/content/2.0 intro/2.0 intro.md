## The Opportunity

**[MAIN PANEL: Changing landscape visual]**

There's something unique happening right now.

Traditional employment is being disrupted. Whole industries are changing. Jobs we thought would be there forever are vanishing.

But with this disruption along with all the uncertainty comes opportunity. Opportunity to reinvent how we work in unprecedented ways.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Disruption = opportunity | Reinvent how we work]**

This trend of solo founders and small teams building their own ventures has been emerging for a while, but AI is supercharging what's possible. One person can now build what used to take entire teams. A new kind of entrepreneur is emerging. 

People are stepping away from traditional jobs and building their own ventures. Small, purposeful and profitable.

We call this Pivoting to Purpose. 

**Tag line:** **The one-person startup is real.**

Pivoting to purpose describes making that step into building your own thing. Creating a new way of life for yourself. A way to generate income, wealth, financial freedom by doing something that you actually believe in. 

Here we focus on 2 important things - firstly size, Pivoting to Purpose is focused on small scale ventures that can be created by solo founders or very small teams, not high-growth startups and social enterprises. And secondly, this is about being purpose driven, stepping into doing something that matters to you. 

This program helps you navigate this step into entrepreneurship, it helps you make sense of what you are doing, helps you manage the risks you are taking, and helps you chart your best course through them to success. 

You might be mid career and looking to transition out of uninspiring work, or you could be self employed and looking build a venture that will scale your efforts beyond dollars for hours toil. Or you are new to the workforce starting out and just aren't inspired by the idea of spending the next few decades working a job you don't like for people you don't respect in service of a mission you don't believe in. 

Any of these sound like you? If so then your in the right place. 

This program is here to help you make this pivot. 


**Tag line:** **You're in the right place.**

**[MAIN PANEL: Honest Hustle visual]**

To be clear! This isn't about sleazy internet hustle culture. The internet is full of people promising get rich quick approaches and promoting a self-centered culture of win by any means necessary. 

Pivoting to purpose is about Honest Hustle.  Bringing the best of yourself. Being smart, being strategic, being successful, while staying grounded in your values. Building success with your soul intact.

It isn't about taking on investors who will push you to think ONLY of financial returns. It is a way for you to balance money, a mission that you care about and a way of life that you want. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Honest Hustle | Success + soul intact | Your values]**

This is the opportunity. To build something that works for you. and that creates value and that matters.

**Tag line:** **Build with integrity.**

------------
## Purpose is your Advantage

**[MAIN PANEL: Purpose is your advantage - visual]**

And in a world becoming increasingly uncertain and untrustworthy, purpose becomes your advantage. It helps you cut through the noise.

Customers of ventures that have purpose at their heart are more engaged, more loyal and more likely to refer others. Purpose isn't just feel-good anymore - it's becoming a strategic advantage.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Purpose cuts through noise | Engaged customers | Strategic advantage]**

Whether you're trying to change the world take just build a foundation for your family's happiness, integrating your purpose into what you're building is now a complete no-brainer. In fact when you've done it, it will seem crazy to think that you could ever build something that doesn't embody your purpose and values.

**Tag line:** **Purpose is advantage.**

## Building a Machine

**[MAIN PANEL: You're Building a Machine]**

In building your venture - You're not creating a job. You're building a machine.

In the past, leaving traditional employment meant becoming a freelancer or consultant. Trading the certainty of a job, for the uncertain of trading time for money.

But pivoting to building a venture is different. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Not a job | Building a machine | Leverage on your time]**

You're building a business model that creates value beyond your time. A machine you own, that produces more than you could by yourself. That gives you leverage and creates financial independence.

And this, in turn creates more of the good things you're trying to manifest in the world.

**Tag line:** **Build a machine.**

We call this machine a Pivot Purpose venture - or p2p venture. A scalable repeatable business model, that enables you to pivot away from the traditional working world while pursuing things that are important to you. 

**Tag line:** **Building a P2P Venture.**

## How This Program Works
**[VISUAL TEXT: How the Program Works**

**[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas example]**

The Social Lean Canvas system has been developed over more than ten years. It's been used with thousands of social ventures, accelerators, and incubator programs.

It's the fastest and most reliable way to map, test, and build ideas into successful business models.

**[VISUAL TEXT: 10+ years | Thousands of ventures | Proven system]**

The canvas maps your entire business model. Everything visible. Details and big picture together.

**Tag line:** **See everything at once.**

---

**[MAIN PANEL: Scale spectrum visual - solo to corporation]**

This isn't a narrow methodology that tries to squeeze every venture into one-size-fits-all.

The canvas system can support all kinds of entrepreneurs that want to take a purpose-driven approach to building a venture

It works for a solo founder creating something they can run by themselves. It works for building a giant corporation or social enterprise. And everything in between.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Solo entrepreneur → Corporation | Universal framework | Any scale]**

In Pivoting to Purpose, we're focusing on starting small - solo or small team ventures. But the Social Lean Canvas can handle any direction you choose to go in.

The framework is universal. Your application of it is specific.

**Tag line:** **Universal framework, your scale.**

---

**[MAIN PANEL: Three models integration diagram]**

The canvas weaves together three models that work as a system:

Your Customer Model - how your venture creates value for customers.

Your Impact Model - the logic for how your venture delivers on your purpose.

And Your Economic Model - how money flows through your venture to make it financially successful.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Customer Model | Impact Model | Economic Model]**

These three models interrelate. They influence each other. Together, they form your complete business model.

**Tag line:** **Three models, one system.**

---

**[MAIN PANEL: Program structure - three modules]**

The p2p program is structured in three modules. Each module builds on the last. And Each creates a clear deliverable.

**Tag line:** **Three modules ahead.**

---

### Module 1: Design Your Business Model

**[MAIN PANEL: Canvas sections highlighted]**
Module 1 - Design your business model 
The output of this will be your completed Social Lean Canvas.


This module introduces you to the fundamentals of how to design a business model 
And then guides you through sketching a first draft of your idea in the social lean canvas.

You'll work through each section of the cavas, mapping your idea into a comprehensive business model. By the end, you'll see how all the pieces fit together into a single coherent model. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: 5 sections | Complete canvas | See how it fits]**

**Tag line:** **Map your model.**

---

### Module 2: Improve Your Business Model

**[MAIN PANEL: Improvement process visual]**

Module 2: Improve Your Business Model
The output of this is a Strengthened business model with clear assumptions.

In this module you will improve what you've mapped. Work through each model systematically. Identify weak points. Fix them. And Clarify your riskiest assumptions.

This module makes your business model as strong as possible before you start testing it.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Improve systematically | Fix weak points | Ready to test]**

**Tag line:** **Strengthen your model.**

---

### Module 3: Build Your Strategy

**[MAIN PANEL: Strategy model with three layers]**

Module 3: Build Your Strategy
The output of this is a Complete validation plan and multilayer strategy .

This module has 3  sections that build your complete strategy.

Firstly - Assessing where you are. Your current stage of development 

Then Creating a validation plan for your customer, impact model, and economic models. These specify exactly what you need to do to develop each one.

And the finally Building your strategy. This consists of three strategic layers - business model development, organizational development and capital strategy - all working together across a timeline.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Assess stage | Validation plans | Complete strategy]**

By the end, you have a clear but flexible roadmap. You know what you're doing, when you are doing is, and what resources you need to get it done. .

**Tag line:** **Build your strategy.**

---

### How It Builds

**[MAIN PANEL: Progressive building visual showing module connections]**

Each module creates a deliverable. Each deliverable feeds the next.

Module 1 gives you your canvas. Module 2 strengthens it. Module 3 turns it into an executable strategy.

Progressive clarity. Going from vague idea to concrete plan.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Map | Improve | Execute | Progressive clarity]**

Then your canvas and your strategy evolve as you develop your venture. As you build your venture you loop through this process folding in learning and progress as you go.  Each time through, your business model gets stronger. Your strategy gets clearer. Uncertainty gets replaced with proof. 
These become your single source of truth, you canvas the description of the business model you are going to succeed with, and your strategy, the plan that you are executing on to get there.


Then this process repeats.

As you execute your strategy. You run experiments. You learn. Some assumptions prove true, others don't. You discover new insights.

Then you come back through. Update your canvas with what you learned. Improve it based on new knowledge. Rebuild your strategy. Execute again.

**[MAIN PANEL: Iterative cycle diagram]**

Each time through, your business model gets stronger. Your strategy gets clearer. Uncertainty gets replaced with proof.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Execute → Learn → Improve → Strategize → Execute]**

This is how you go from idea to success. Not in one pass, but through systematic iteration.

**Tag line:** **Iterate to success.**

**[MAIN PANEL: Forward momentum visual]**

employment is being disrupted.

12
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:44,878
Whole industries are changing jobs

are vanishing,   but with this
disruption, along with all the

uncertainty, comes opportunity.

15

Opportunity to reinvent how
we work in unprecedented ways.

16
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:59,231
This trend of solo founders and small
teams building their own ventures has been

17
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:03,992
emerging for a while,  But the development
of AI is supercharging what's possible.

Small, purposeful, and profitable.

22
00:01:18,074 --> 00:01:20,744
We call doing this pivoting to purpose.

23
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:26,203
Pivoting to purpose describes making
that step into building your own thing,

24
00:01:26,648 --> 00:01:30,302
A way to generate income, wealth,
and financial freedom while doing

25

something you actually believe in.

26
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:35,227
Here we focus on two important things.

27
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:40,629
Firstly, size pivoting to purpose is
focused on small scale ventures   can be

28
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:45,523
created by solo founders and very small
teams,  Not high growth startups and

29
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:50,337
huge social enterprises,  and secondly,
this is about being purpose driven.

30
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:53,112
Stepping into doing something
that matters to you.

31
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:56,913
It helps you make sense of what
you're doing, manage the risks you're

32
00:01:56,913 --> 00:02:00,663
taking, and helps you chart your
best course through them to success.

33
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:05,371
You might be mid-career and looking
to transition out of uninspiring

34
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:09,015
work, or you could be self-employed
and looking to build a venture that

35
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:13,182
will scale your efforts beyond dollars
for hours, toil, Or perhaps you're

36
00:02:13,182 --> 00:02:15,012
new to the workforce starting out.

37
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:19,713
And just aren't inspired by the idea of
spending the next few decades working a

38
00:02:19,713 --> 00:02:23,916
job you don't like for people you don't
respect in service of a mission, you don't

39
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,408
believe in any of these sound like you.

40
00:02:26,618 --> 00:02:28,478
If so, you're in the right place.

41
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,100
This program is here to
help you make this pivot.

42
00:02:32,123 --> 00:02:35,901
To be clear, this isn't about
sleazy internet hustle culture.

43
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:38,179
The internet is full of people promising.

44
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:39,859
Get rich quick approaches.

45
00:02:40,112 --> 00:02:44,006
And promoting a self-centered culture
of win by any means necessary.

46
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:47,047
Pivoting to purpose is
about honest hustle.

47
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:52,123
Bringing the best of yourself, being
smart, being strategic, being successful

48
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:54,250
While staying grounded in your values.

49
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:57,182
Building success with your soul intact.

50
00:02:57,881 --> 00:03:00,641
It isn't about taking on
investors who will push you to

51
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:02,561
only think of financial returns.

52
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:06,313
It's a way for you to balance
money, a mission you care about

53
00:03:06,343 --> 00:03:07,903
and a way of life that you want.

54
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:12,439
in a world becoming increasingly
uncertain and untrustworthy.

55
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:14,449
Purpose becomes your advantage.

56
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,535
It helps you cut through the noise.

57
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:20,520
Customers of ventures that have purpose
at their heart are more engaged, more

58
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,070
loyal, and more likely to refer others.

59
00:03:23,327 --> 00:03:25,637
Purpose isn't just feel good anymore.

60
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:27,437
It's becoming a strategic advantage.

61
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:31,768
Whether you're trying to change the
world or just build a foundation for

62
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:35,108
your family's happiness, Integrating
purpose into what you're building

63
00:03:35,108 --> 00:03:36,728
is now a complete no-brainer.

64
00:03:37,101 --> 00:03:40,213
In fact, when you've done it, It will
seem crazy to think that you could

65
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:43,603
ever build something that didn't
embody your purpose and values it.

66
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,480
In building a venture, you're
not creating a job for yourself.

67
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:48,634
You're building a machine.

68
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:52,603
In the past, leaving traditional
employment meant becoming a

69
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:57,151
freelancer or a consultant, Swapping
the certainty of a job for the

70
00:03:57,151 --> 00:03:59,701
uncertainty of trading time for money.

71
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,796
But pivoting to building
a venture is different.

72
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:06,972
You're building a business model
that creates value beyond your time.

73
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:11,759
A machine that you own that produces
more than you could produce by yourself.

74
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,852
We call this machine a pivot to
purpose venture, or P two P venture,

75
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,381
A scalable, repeatable business model
That enables you to pivot away from the

76
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:23,647
traditional working world while pursuing
things that are important to you.

The Social Lean Canvas system has been
developed over more than 10 years.

00:00:03,845 --> 00:00:07,198
It's been used with thousands of
social ventures, accelerators,

into successful business models.

6
00:00:15,668 --> 00:00:18,542
The canvas maps your entire
business model, everything, visible

7
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:20,852
details, and big picture together.

8
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,536
This isn't a narrow methodology
that tries to squeeze every

9
00:00:24,536 --> 00:00:26,726
venture into a one size fits all.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,378

all kinds of entrepreneurs that

00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:33,228
want to take a purpose-driven
approach to building a venture.

It works for a solo founder creating
something they can run by themselves.

13
00:00:37,924 --> 00:00:42,461
It works for a giant corporation or social
enterprise  and everything in between.

14
00:00:43,132 --> 00:00:47,613
In pivoting to purpose, we're focusing
on starting small solo or small team

15
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:51,783
ventures, but the social in canvas can
handle any direction you choose to go in.

16
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:53,687
The framework is universal.

17
00:00:53,758 --> 00:00:55,738
Your application of it is specific.

18
00:00:56,568 --> 00:01:00,703
The canvas weaves together three
models that work as a system, your

19
00:01:00,703 --> 00:01:03,694
customer model, how your venture
creates value for customers.

20
00:01:04,491 --> 00:01:08,235
Your impact model the logic for how
your venture delivers on your purpose.

21
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:12,316
and your economic model, how money
flows through your venture to

22
00:01:12,316 --> 00:01:13,996
make it financially successful.

23
00:01:14,543 --> 00:01:16,340
These three models interrelate.

24
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,603
They influence each other together.

25
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:20,733
They form your complete business model.

26
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:24,784
The P two P program is
structured in three modules.

27
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:29,541
Each module builds on the last, and
each creates a clear deliverable.

28
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:32,188
