**Tag line: "From model to action"**

### Bridge from Improving Business Model

You've done the hard work. You've assessed your customer model, your impact model, and your economic model. You've identified weaknesses and strengthened them. You've moved beyond back-of-napkin thinking.

`[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas - full view]`

You now have one or more business models that are good enough to test.

So what's next?

Now you need strategy. You need to turn your business model into action.

### Why Strategy Matters

Strategy is what directs your time, effort, and money into the most important and valuable activities.

Missing on strategy is just as bad as missing on business model design.

There are a million ways to burn time, money, and effort going in the wrong direction and getting nowhere. Threading a path for your venture through all the potential missteps - that's the job of good strategy.


## Strategy as a living process

It is also important for strategy to be a flexible and evolving process. Because you will be constantly evolving your business model as you validate it, you will constantly evolve your strategy as well. Developing your strategy can't be about creating a giant document that everyone will blindly follow. It needs to be a flexible and evolving process that any any point in time captures your best path forward in your current reality. 

The strategy model is designed to be a living document that you constantly update as you learn and iterate your business model.

### The Validation Journey

You'll recall from the module on business model design that the journey from untested business model idea to successful venture is one of validation and iteration.

Taking untested assumptions in your business model, testing them, and then evolving the business model as you learn.

This journey is what your strategy will map. It will make sure you're taking sensible next steps and not wasting your time and money on useless activities.


### What This Module Covers

In this module, we'll work through three key steps:

First, assessing the stage of your venture's development. Understanding where you are on the journey.

Second, validation. How to develop a plan to validate the riskiest parts of your business model.

And third, building your strategy. Wrapping all this up into a strategy that covers what you're going to do, how you're going to do it, and what funding you'll need and when to make this possible.

`[VISUAL TEXT: assess stage | plan validation | build strategy]`

To make this concrete, we'll follow an example throughout. We'll use a fictional early-stage version of Toast Ale - a purpose-driven brewery that makes beer from surplus bread to fight food waste.

This isn't their actual history. We're imagining what their journey might have looked like at the idea stage. Think of this as a case study to help you understand the process.

Let's get started.

1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,320
Now that you've done the work of assessing
your business model and strengthening

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,827
it, and you have one or more business
models that are good enough to test

3
00:00:07,157 --> 00:00:11,244
what's next, Now you need to develop
a strategy to test your business

4
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,254
model and execute it in the world.

5
00:00:14,035 --> 00:00:17,910
Strategy is what directs your time,
effort, and money into the most

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,830
important and valuable activities.

7
00:00:20,342 --> 00:00:22,804
Missing on strategy is
just as bad as missing.

8
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:24,034
On business model design.

9
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:28,246
There are millions of ways to burn
money, time and effort, going in the

10
00:00:28,246 --> 00:00:29,986
wrong direction and getting nowhere.

11
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:33,862
Threading a path for your venture
through all of the potential missteps

12
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:35,692
is the job of a good strategy.

13
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:41,003
It is also important for your strategy
to be a flexible and evolving process

14
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:44,753
because you'll be constantly evolving
your business model as you validate it.

15
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:47,940
You will need to constantly
evolve your strategy as well.

16
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:52,248
Developing your strategy can't be
about creating a giant document that

17
00:00:52,248 --> 00:00:53,868
everyone will just blindly follow.

18
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:58,536
It needs to be a flexible and
evolving process that at any point

19
00:00:58,536 --> 00:01:02,487
in time captures your best path
forward in your current reality.

20
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:07,296
This strategy model is designed
to be a living document that you

21
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:10,656
constantly update as you learn
and iterate your business model.

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,862
You'll recall from the module on
business model design that the

23
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:18,342
journey from untested business
model to successful venture is

24
00:01:18,342 --> 00:01:20,712
one of validation and iteration.

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,198
Taking untested assumptions in your
business model, testing them, and

26
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:26,728
then evolving your business model.

27
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:29,978
As you learn  this journey is
what your strategy will map.

28
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,114
It will make sure that you're taking
sensible next steps and not wasting your

29
00:01:34,114 --> 00:01:36,634
time and money on useless activities.

30
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,449
In this module, we'll work
through three key steps.

31
00:01:41,574 --> 00:01:45,681
First, assessing the stage of your
ventures development, understanding

32
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:46,706
where you are on the journey.

33
00:01:48,143 --> 00:01:52,433
Second, validation, how to develop
a plan to validate the riskiest

34
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:53,753
parts of your business model.

35
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,999
And third, building your strategy.

36
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:00,478
wrapping all this into a single plan
that covers what you're gonna do, how

37
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,732
you're gonna do it, and what funding
you'll need to make it possible.

38
00:02:04,596 --> 00:02:05,676
To make this concrete.

39
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:07,144
We'll follow an example throughout.

40
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:11,617
We're gonna base this example
on Toast Ale, a purpose-driven

41
00:02:11,617 --> 00:02:15,157
brewery that makes beer from
surplus bread to fight food waste.

42
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:18,276
but to be clear, this isn't
the actual history of to ale.

43
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:20,932
We're imagining what their
journey might have looked like.

44
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:24,800
Think of this as a fictional case study
to help you understand the process.

45
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,270
Let's get started.
