**[MAIN PANEL: Understanding Business model Design]**
**[MAIN PANEL: Empty Social Lean Canvas outline]**

**Script (spoken):**

Before we dive into filling in your business model in the Social Lean Canvas, it's important that we understand what a business model actually is and how the journey of creating a successful one actually works. If you're considering leaving your job and pivoting to purpose, getting these fundamentals right isn't optional—it's critical.

When you're bootstrapping solo or with a small team to build a venture, you can't afford to waste time, money, or energy guessing at a business model. You don't have the safety net of a large team or investor capital to cover mistakes. Getting the business model fundamentals right is your foundation for the journey ahead.

**[VISUAL TEXT: The fundamentals  matter]**

You're about to work through the Core content on business model design— these are the universal frameworks that apply to any venture. The Core Framework will walk you through what a business model is, why design beats guesswork, and the critical distinction between startups and businesses.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Core Framework ahead | Universal principles | P2P application follows]**

After the Core content, we'll come back and talk about what makes Purpose Pivot Ventures different from other paths to venture building - like high-growth startups and social enterprises , which is covered in the core content. We'll also introduce resources you can return to throughout the program to make sense of your journey.

## P2P COMMENTARY

<span style="color:green"> p2p 3.1 understanding-business-model-design2.webm</span> 


**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Pivot to Purpose Ventures"]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just walked you through business model fundamentals—what a model is, why design matters, and the startup journey from search to validation to execution. These are universal principles. Now let's talk about what makes a Purpose Pivot Venture different and why this moment is ripe with opportunity.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Universal principles | P2P distinctions]**

---

### What's different when you're pivoting to purpose?

[VISUAL TEXT: What's different when you're pivoting to purpose?]

**[MAIN PANEL: Three-part visual - Startup path vs P2P path vs Job replacement] (create new - animates with sections)**

There are three things that distinguish small, purpose driven ventures like yours from other paths you might take.

#### Different from a High-Growth Startup

First, a Purpose Pivot Venture is different from building a high-growth startup. The traditional startup path is straightforward—raise money, build a team, scale fast, eventually sell the company so investors can make their return. That path exists, and you can take it if it fits your goals. But it's not what we're focused on here.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Traditional startup | Raise capital | Scale fast | Exit]**

A Purpose Pivot Venture might stay small or grow slowly. You might take no investment and end up with 100% ownership. You might never sell it. You might stay solo or build a really small team, leveraging AI and other modern tools to skip the high-growth, investment-driven approach entirely.

Small by design is legitimate. Slow growth is fine. You're building a machine that serves your life, not serving a machine that demands hypergrowth.

**[VISUAL TEXT: P2P| Stay small | Grow slowly | Keep ownership | Leverage AI]**

**Tag line:** **Not all ventures scale big.**

---

#### More Than Money

Second, a Purpose Pivot Venture is not about business and money above everything. Pivoting to purpose is about building something that helps you act and feel more in line with your values than you do in your current corporate job—or wherever you are right now.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Values alignment | Integrate who you are with what you do]**

You're integrating how you want to be in the world with how you sustain yourself financially and generate wealth. This might manifest as a full social enterprise with a comprehensive theory of change driving your venture. Or it might be commitments you make to yourself about how you want to show up as you do this work. Either way, this purpose focus makes a Purpose Pivot Venture something you can fully commit your whole self to.

We'll explore the spectrum of purpose in more depth when we get to the Purpose section. 

**Tag line:** **Align values and work.**

---

#### Not Just Another Type of Job

Third, what we are talking about here is not about creating a job for yourself—essentially taking your existing job and removing all the security it offers. It's not about becoming a freelancer where you trade one kind of dissatisfaction—no meaning, no control—for another—uncertainty about where the next paycheck comes from.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Not freelancing | Not job replacement | Business ownership]**

Pivoting to purpose is about harnessing the power of business ownership to find meaningful ways to contribute to the world that can bring you financial independence. You're building a machine that generates freedom—not just income, but the ability to make choices about your time, your work, and your life.

This is why the business model design work matters so much. You're not just finding clients. You're designing a system that creates value, delivers it efficiently, captures revenue, and manages costs—all while aligned with your purpose.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Build a machine | Freedom + Income | Meaningful contribution]**

**Tag line:** **Ownership creates freedom.**

---

### Business Model Fundamentals for P2P

**[MAIN PANEL: The four components - Create | Deliver | Capture | Manage] (take from core)**

The Core Framework showed you the four pieces of any business model—create value, deliver value, capture value, manage costs. Purpose Pivot Ventures still need all four. Whether you're building a micro-SaaS product, offering productized services, or creating a content-driven community, these pieces must work together. The scale might be smaller, the approach more automated, but the logic is the same.

And if you're aiming for measurable impact beyond your own livelihood, you add the impact dimension—the fifth piece that sits alongside the commercial model.

**[VISUAL TEXT: PPV = Create | Deliver | Capture | Manage + Impact]**

**Tag line:** **Same pieces, your scale.**

---

### Why Design Matters for Solo Founders

The Core content made the case that design beats guesswork. For Purpose Pivot Ventures, this matters even more. When you're solo or with a small team, you don't have a safety net of people to catch mistakes or pivot quickly when something breaks. You're bootstrapping—likely while still employed—so every decision counts. You can't afford to spend six months building the wrong thing.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Solo = No safety net | Every choice counts]**

This is where **Honest Hustle** comes in. We're not talking about internet hustle culture—growth hacks and hype. We're talking about designing your business model with intention, testing it rigorously, and building something that makes money _and_ makes sense for the life you want. Design your model deliberately. Test it. Prove it works. Then scale it.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Honest Hustle | Design with intention]**

**Tag line:** **Design with intention.**

---

### The Startup Journey: Search Phase and Employment

**[MAIN PANEL: Startup Journey diagram - Search → Validate → Execute]**

Now, the startup journey. This is where things get specifically relevant to Purpose Pivot Ventures.

The Core Framework showed you the search phase—where you're testing assumptions and validating your model. This phase is perfect for evenings and weekends if you need to keep your existing job. You don't have to quit on day one. In fact, you shouldn't.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Search phase | Evenings + weekends | Stay employed]**

If you need to keep your existing job, keep it during the search phase. Only make the leap once your model is validated and generating meaningful revenue. This removes massive financial pressure and lets you validate thoroughly rather than rushing because your runway is burning. Different people are in different situations, but if staying employed is an option, use it strategically.

Modern AI tools make solo validation faster and more feasible than ever before. You can do customer research, build MVPs, and test core assumptions with tools that didn't exist two years ago. We'll cover specific tools in later sections, but know that being solo doesn't mean being stuck. You have leverage that previous generations didn't have.

**[VISUAL TEXT: AI tools enable solo validation]**

**Tag line:** **Search while employed.**

---

### Founder First: You ARE the Team

The Core content emphasized "Founders First"—founders must own the key decisions early on. For Purpose Pivot Ventures, this becomes "Founder First." You _are_ the team in the early stage. You can't outsource customer discovery or value proposition design. You have to learn directly from customers and make the calls yourself.

AI tools can augment you significantly. You're solo, but you're not doing it with 1990s constraints. You make the calls, but you have powerful tools to help you execute.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Founder First | AI augments | You decide]**

**Tag line:** **Own the decisions.**

---

### Validation Pacing for P2P

Here's a critical mindset shift: slower validation is okay when you're keeping your job. The pressure isn't "validate in 12 weeks or die." It's "validate thoroughly, build confidence in the model, then make the leap." Better to take an extra three months proving the model works than quitting too early and failing under financial stress.

**Tag line:** **Validate thoroughly first.**

---

### Resources: Venture Typology and Example Libraries

**[
**Tag line:** "Six patterns, not six boxes"

[MAIN PANEL: Visual diagram showing 6 categories in a simple layout]

[VISUAL TEXT: 6 Common P2P Business Model Patterns]

When I look across the landscape of successful purpose pivots - solo founders and small teams building sustainable ventures - I see 6 common patterns emerging. These aren't rigid categories you have to fit into. Think of them as a pattern library - archetypes that can help you recognize what's working in the real world.

**1. Software & AI** Micro-SaaS products, AI copilots, developer tools, browser extensions - digital products that solve specific problems and can run with minimal ongoing involvement once built.

**2. Productized Services**  
Services packaged like products - design-as-a-service, automation retainers, AI agents handling specific workflows - where you systematize expert work so it scales without linear time investment.

**3. Consulting & Coaching** Expert guidance packaged efficiently - AI enablement consulting, fractional leadership, platform expertise, personal knowledge management coaching - where your specialized knowledge creates high value without requiring a large team.

**4. Content, Education & Community** Newsletter-led businesses, book-led businesses, podcast-led communities, online courses, cohort-based programs - where you build audience and monetize through multiple channels.

**5. Digital Goods & Commerce** Templates, creative assets, printables, data products, print-on-demand micro-brands - digital or digital-enabled physical products with high margins and low overhead.

**6. Local, Regenerative & Physical** Circular economy services, reusables-as-a-service, community sensor networks, urban mining - place-based or physically-grounded ventures often with strong regenerative or environmental purpose.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Pattern library, not personality test]**

The key thing to understand: different examples from these categories will be relevant to you at different times. As we work through your Customer Model, you might relate most to a Software & AI example. When we hit Economic Model, maybe a Productized Service example shows you a better cost structure approach. Use these as reference points and inspiration, not rigid templates.

If you want to go deeper into the venture typology - see more examples in each category, understand the common business model patterns within each - check out the venture typology deep dive. But for now, this overview is enough.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Patterns, not blueprints]**

### The Example Libraries

**Tag line:** "Learn from real ventures, not theory"

[MAIN PANEL: Split screen or toggle showing both library options]

[VISUAL TEXT: Two Example Libraries]

Throughout this program, you have access to two example libraries that show you real ventures using the Social Lean Canvas framework.

**The Core Example Library** contains purpose-driven ventures of all types - from fully-developed social enterprises with deep impact models to traditional businesses with strong purpose integration. These examples show the full range of what's possible with the framework and demonstrate how different ventures apply it. You'll find established companies like Patagonia alongside newer social innovations.

**The P2P Example Library** is specifically curated for ventures that fit the 6 patterns we just looked at. These are ventures built by solo founders or very small teams - the kinds of businesses you might recognize yourself in. Each one has a video walkthrough that shows you not just their completed canvas, but the story of how their business model works and why certain choices mattered.

[MAIN PANEL: Show one P2P example canvas - maybe DesignJoy or Plausible Analytics]

**[VISUAL TEXT: Example - DesignJoy]** (or whichever you choose)

Let me show you one quickly. This is DesignJoy - a productized design service that packages unlimited design work into a fixed monthly subscription. You can see their full Customer Model, Impact Model, Economic Model laid out. 

This is what you'll find for about a dozen P2P ventures - real businesses you can study section by section.

As we work through filling in your canvas, I'll point you to relevant examples. When we hit Customer Model, you might want to watch how Plausible Analytics identified their early adopters. When we get to Economic Model, you might look at how a content-led business structures their revenue streams differently than a SaaS product.



**[VISUAL TEXT: Use as reference points, not blueprints]**

Remember - these are reference points, not blueprints. Your venture will be unique. But seeing how others solved similar problems is invaluable.

### Moving Forward

**[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas outline]**

You've got the fundamentals now—what a business model is, why design matters, and how the startup journey works. You understand what makes Purpose Pivot Ventures different: not the high-growth startup path, more than just money, and building ownership rather than another job.


**[VISUAL TEXT: Prove it | Build confidence | Then leap]**

Next, we'll start filling in your Canvas, section by section. The typology and example libraries are there when you need them.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,539
Before we dive into filling in your
business model, in the Social Link canvas,

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,842
it's important that we understand what
a business model actually is and how

3
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:12,273
the journey of creating a successful
one actually works if you're considering

4
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:14,643
leaving your job and pivoting to purpose.

5
00:00:14,651 --> 00:00:17,315
Getting these fundamentals
right is an optional.

6
00:00:17,345 --> 00:00:20,303
It's critical when you're
bootstrapping solo or with a

7
00:00:20,303 --> 00:00:21,738
small team to build a venture.

8
00:00:22,257 --> 00:00:25,280
You can't afford to waste
time, money, or energy.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,627
Guessing at a business model, you don't
have the safety net of a large team

10
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:31,847
or investor capital to cover mistakes.

11
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:36,332
So getting the business model fundamentals
right at the start is an important

12
00:00:36,332 --> 00:00:38,042
foundation for your journey ahead.

13
00:00:39,318 --> 00:00:42,888
You're about to work through the core
content on business model design.

14
00:00:43,307 --> 00:00:46,397
These are the universal frameworks
that apply to any venture.

15
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:51,382
The core framework will walk you through
what a business model is, why design

16
00:00:51,382 --> 00:00:55,601
beats guesswork, and the critical
distinction between a startup and

17
00:00:55,601 --> 00:01:00,155
a business  After the core content,
we'll come back and talk about what

18
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:03,245
makes P two P ventures different
from other paths of venture building.

19
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:06,979
Like high growth startups and
social enterprises, which is

20
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:08,179
covered in the core content.

21
00:01:08,618 --> 00:01:12,898
We'll also introduce resources that you
can return to throughout the program

22
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,954
to make sense of your specific journey.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,545
The core framework just walked you
through business model fundamentals.

2
00:00:03,852 --> 00:00:08,473
a business model is, why design
matters, and the startup journey from

3
00:00:08,473 --> 00:00:10,423
search to validation to execution.

4
00:00:11,617 --> 00:00:13,357
These are universal principles.

5
00:00:13,483 --> 00:00:17,910
Now let's talk about what makes P two P
ventures different, why this particular

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,650
moment is ripe with opportunity.

7
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:24,133
There are three important things
that distinguish small purpose-driven

8
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:27,677
ventures like yours from other
paths you might take first.

9
00:00:28,182 --> 00:00:31,572
A P two P venture is different from
building a high growth startup.

10
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:35,057
The traditional startup path
is relatively straightforward.

11
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:39,601
You raise money, build a team, scale
fast, Eventually sell the company so

12
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:41,251
that investors can get their return.

13
00:00:41,907 --> 00:00:45,589
This path exists and you can take
it if it fits your goals,  but it's

14
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:47,089
not what we're focusing on here.

15
00:00:47,968 --> 00:00:51,268
A P two P venture might
stay small or grow slowly.

16
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:54,794
You might take no investment and end
up with a hundred percent ownership.

17
00:00:54,906 --> 00:00:55,986
You might never sell.

18
00:00:56,268 --> 00:01:00,299
You might stay solo or build a
really small team leveraging AI and

19
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:04,129
modern tools to skip the high growth
investment driven approach entirely

20
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:06,386
Small by design is legitimate.

21
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:08,186
Slow growth is fine.

22
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:10,965
You're building a machine
that serves your life.

23
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:13,986
Not serving a machine
that demands hypergrowth.

24
00:01:14,854 --> 00:01:15,311
Second.

25
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:19,451
A PDP venture is not about business
and money above everything else.

26
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,333
Pivoting to purpose is about building
something that helps you act and

27
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,968
feel more in line with your values
than you do in your current job or

28
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:28,318
whatever you're doing right now.

29
00:01:28,717 --> 00:01:32,732
You are integrating how you want to
be in the world with how you sustain

30
00:01:32,732 --> 00:01:34,742
yourself financially and generate wealth.

31
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:39,264
This might manifest as a full social
enterprise with a comprehensive theory

32
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:43,381
of change driving your venture, or
it might just be commitments that

33
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:46,951
you make to yourself about how you
want to show up as you do this work.

34
00:01:47,443 --> 00:01:51,568
Either way, this purpose focus makes
a P two P venture something that you

35
00:01:51,568 --> 00:01:53,488
can fully commit your whole self to.

36
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:57,187
We'll explore the spectrum of
purpose in more depth when we

37
00:01:57,187 --> 00:01:58,513
get into the purpose section.

38
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:03,200
The third important aspect of P two
P Ventures is that we're not talking

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,210
about creating a job for yourself.

40
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,650
Essentially taking your existing job
and removing all the security it offers.

41
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:13,612
It's not about becoming a freelancer
where you trade one kind of challenge.

42
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:17,512
No meaning no control for
another uncertainty about where

43
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,567
your next paycheck comes from.

44
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:18,982
Okay.

45
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:23,127
Pivoting to purpose is about harnessing
the power of business ownership.

46
00:02:23,149 --> 00:02:25,953
To find meaningful ways to
contribute to the world that can

47
00:02:25,953 --> 00:02:27,723
bring you financial independence.

48
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,216
You're building a machine
that generates freedom.

49
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:33,232
not just income, but the ability
to make choices about your

50
00:02:33,232 --> 00:02:35,242
time, your work, and your life.

51
00:02:35,873 --> 00:02:38,834
This is why business model
design work matters so much.

52
00:02:39,122 --> 00:02:42,824
You're not just finding clients,
you're designing a system that creates

53
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:46,964
value, delivers it efficiently,
captures revenue and manages costs.

54
00:02:47,104 --> 00:02:48,629
All well aligned with your purpose.

55
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:54,074
The core framework laid out these four
pieces of any business model,  P two P

56
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:57,871
Ventures still need all four  Whether
you're building a micro SaaS product,

57
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:02,537
offering productized services, or
creating a content driven community, these

58
00:03:02,537 --> 00:03:04,037
business model pieces must work together.

59
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:08,465
The scale might be smaller, the
approach might be more automated,

60
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:10,295
but the logic is the same.

61
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:14,171
And if you're aiming for a measurable
impact beyond your own livelihood.

62
00:03:14,426 --> 00:03:16,196
You add in the impact dimension.

63
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:21,419
The fifth piece that sits alongside the
commercial model,  The core content made

64
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,369
the case that design beats guesswork.

65
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:25,913
For P two P ventures,
this matters even more.

66
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:30,611
When you're solo or with a small team, you
don't have a safety net to catch mistakes.

67
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,060
When you're bootstrapping,
especially spending your own

68
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,890
money, every decision counts.

69
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,172
You can't afford to spend six
months building the wrong thing.

70
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:41,619
This is where Honest Hustle comes in.

71
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:45,145
We're not talking about internet hustle,
culture, growth, hacks, and hype.

72
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,964
We're talking about designing your
business model with intention.

73
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:52,124
Testing it in smart ways building
something that makes money and makes

74
00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:53,534
sense for the life that you want.

75
00:03:53,724 --> 00:03:55,614
Design your business model deliberately.

76
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:59,325
Test it, evolve it, prove that
it works, and then scale it.

77
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:05,097
Now, the startup journey piece, this
is where things get specifically

78
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:06,987
relevant to P two P ventures.

79
00:04:07,485 --> 00:04:11,055
The core framework showed you the
search phase where your testing

80
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:12,975
assumptions and validating your model.

81
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:16,167
This phase is perfect for
evenings and weekends.

82
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:19,676
If you need to keep your existing
job, Only make the leap when your

83
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:23,536
model is validated in generating
meaningful income, This removes

84
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:27,376
massive financial pressure and lets
you validate thoroughly rather than

85
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:29,356
rushing because your runway is burning.

86
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,530
different people are in different
situations, but if staying employed

87
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,660
as an option, use it strategically.

88
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,395
Modern AI tools make solo validation
faster and more feasible than ever before.

89
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:45,914
You can do customer research, build
MVPs, test core assumptions with

90
00:04:45,914 --> 00:04:48,013
tools that didn't exist two years ago.

91
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,940
We'll cover specific tools in
later sections, but know that being

92
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,920
solo doesn't mean being stuck.

93
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,536
You have leverage that previous
generations just didn't have.

94
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,633
The core content also emphasized.

95
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,863
Founders first.

96
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:04,537
Founders must own the
key decisions early on.

97
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:07,755
For P two P Ventures, this
becomes founder first.

98
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:08,829
You are the team.

99
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:12,241
In the early stages, You can't
outsource customer discovery

100
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:13,891
or value proposition design.

101
00:05:14,132 --> 00:05:17,931
You have to learn directly from your
customers and make the calls yourself.

102
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:21,064
AI tools can augment you significantly.

103
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:26,362
But you make the calls,  There's
a critical P two P mindset shift.

104
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:29,409
Slower validation is okay
when you're keeping your job.

105
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,534
The pressure isn't validated
in 12 weeks or die.

106
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:37,490
It's validate thoroughly, build confidence
in the model, then make the leap Better

107
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,420
to take an extra three months proving
that the model works, then quitting too

108
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,820
early and failing under financial stress.

109
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,388
When we look across the landscape
of successful purpose pivots,

110
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:51,598
solo founders and small teams
building sustainable ventures.

111
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:54,182
We see six common patterns emerging.

112
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:57,060
These aren't rigid categories
that you have to fit into.

113
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:01,691
Think of them as a patent library
archetypes that can help you recognize

114
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:03,311
what's working in the real world.

115
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:09,085
These different types of P two P ventures
are software and ai,  productized

116
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:14,509
services,  consulting and coaching,
content, education and community,

117
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:19,525
digital goods and commerce, and local
regenerative and physical ventures.

118
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:24,067
We've put together a typology with
different examples of ventures

119
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:25,717
that fit into these categories.

120
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:29,918
The important thing to understand is that
different examples from each category will

121
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,348
be relevant to you at different times.

122
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,230
as we work through your customer model,
you might relate most to a software and

123
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,183
AI example when we hit economic model.

124
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:44,153
Maybe a productized service example shows
you a better cost structure approach.

125
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:48,965
Use these categories and examples
as reference points and inspiration,

126
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:50,255
but not as rigid templates.

127
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,934
If you want to go deeper into
the venture typology, See more

128
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:56,404
examples in each category.

129
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:59,194
Understand the common business
model patterns within each.

130
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:01,081
check out the Venture Typology.

131
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:01,501
Deep dive.

132
00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:06,259
throughout this program, you have
access to two example libraries That

133
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,889
show you real venture examples in
the Social Link Canvas framework.

134
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:14,236
The core example library contains
purpose-driven ventures of all types.

135
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,570
From fully developed social
enterprises with deep impact

136
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,542
models to traditional businesses
with strong purpose integration.

137
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,740
These examples show you the full
range of what's possible with the

138
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,702
framework and demonstrate how it's
applied to different ventures.

139
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:33,140
You'll find established purpose-driven
ventures like Patagonia, alongside

140
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,460
newer social innovations.

141
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,473
The P two P library is specifically
curated for ventures that fit the

142
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:41,123
six patterns that we just looked at.

143
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:45,217
These are ventures built by solo
founders or very small teams.

144
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,471
The kinds of businesses that you might
recognize yourself in  Each one has

145
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:53,468
a walkthrough that shows you not just
their completed canvas, but the story

146
00:07:53,468 --> 00:07:56,108
of how their business model works
and why certain choices mattered.

147
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,500
Let me show you one quickly.

148
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:03,561
This is Design Joy, A productized design
service that packages unlimited design

149
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:05,811
work into a fixed monthly subscription.

150
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:10,365
You can see their full customer model,
impact model, and economic model laid out.

151
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:14,647
This is what you'll find for a bunch
of P two P ventures, Real ventures that

152
00:08:14,647 --> 00:08:18,871
you can study section by section As we
work through filling in your canvas.

153
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:22,459
I'll point you to relevant examples
when we hit customer model.

154
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:27,079
You might want to watch how plausible
analytics identify their early adopters.

155
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:31,697
When we get to economic model, you
might look at how a content led business

156
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:35,087
structures their revenue streams
differently from assess product.

157
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:38,387
Remember, these are reference
points, not blueprints.

158
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:41,753
Your venture will be unique, but
seeing how others have solved

159
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:43,583
similar problems is invaluable.

160
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,812
You've got the fundamentals.

161
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:50,495
Now, what a business model is, why design
matters and how the startup journey works.

162
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,770
You understand what makes
P two P ventures different?

163
00:08:54,102 --> 00:08:55,744
Not the high growth startup path.

164
00:08:55,894 --> 00:08:59,749
More than just money and building
ownership rather than another job.

165
00:09:00,435 --> 00:09:03,398
Next we'll start filling in the
canvas section by section, the

166
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:06,698
typology and example libraries
are there when you need them.
