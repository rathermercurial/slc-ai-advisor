### Step 1: Building Your Business Model Layer

Start with your validation plans from sections 

`[MAIN PANEL: Validation plans ready to map onto timeline]`

These experiments and activities become your business model layer. You're mapping them onto the timeline and sequencing them logically.

Some experiments need to happen before others. Customer discovery before quantitative testing. Impact model research before running pilots. Certain economic assumptions can only be tested after customer assumptions are validated.

Work through this sequencing. What must come first? What can happen in parallel? What are the dependencies?

Let's see what this might have looked like for Toast Ale.

### Toast Ale: Business Model Layer

The founders take their validation plans and map them across the timeline.

`[MAIN PANEL: Toast Ale business model layer on strategy model template]`

**0-2 Months: Customer Discovery and Impact Research**

The first two months are all about discovery. They're running twenty to thirty customer interviews with craft beer enthusiasts to understand their jobs to be done and test different value propositions. At the same time, they're having ten conversations with bakeries about surplus bread - understanding volumes, logistics, and willingness to partner.

They're brewing small homebrew batches for taste tests. Testing different positioning approaches. Does "beer made from surplus bread" work better than "fighting food waste one beer at a time"? They're learning the language that resonates.

On the impact side, they're doing research. What does the literature say about food waste's environmental impact? What are the emissions from bread waste in landfills? How much bread waste exists in their city? They're also talking to environmental charities about potential partnership models.

These are mostly qualitative, exploratory activities. Low cost, high learning. This is pure discovery.

**2-6 Months: Quantitative Testing**

Once they've completed Customer Discovery and understand what resonates, they move to proof at scale. They brew a larger batch - five hundred bottles. This isn't homebrew anymore - they're partnering with a local brewery to produce at commercial quality.

They place the beer in ten bottle shops across the city. Now they're measuring real numbers. What's the shelf-to-purchase conversion rate? What does it actually cost to acquire a customer through this channel? Does the five dollar price point hold up when people encounter it in a retail environment? Are people coming back for more?

On the impact side, they're formalizing partnerships with three bakeries. They're collecting bread for three months and measuring actual diversion. How much bread are they really diverting from landfill? What are the logistics costs? They're piloting the charity funding mechanism - do the economics allow them to donate meaningful amounts?

This phase is about proving that the insights from discovery hold up with real numbers.

**6-18 Months: Scale and Formalize**

If the pilot proves the model works - if conversion rates are strong, if unit economics are positive, if impact is measurable - then they're ready to scale.

They move to producing five thousand bottles per month. They expand distribution to fifty bottle shops. They're building a real brand now, using the sustainability story to drive awareness. They formalize bakery partnerships with actual contracts. They establish a regular rhythm of charity funding based on profits.

This is the transition from validation to execution. They're not just testing anymore - they're building a business.

`[VISUAL TEXT: 0-2 = discovery | 2-6 = proof at scale | 6-18 = scale & formalize]`

This is their business model layer. It shows what they're validating and building, when, and in what order.

### Step 2: Building Your Organizational Layer

Now ask: What organizational pieces need to be in place to execute this business model strategy?

For each phase of your timeline, think through:

**People** - Who needs to be involved? Part-time or full-time? What roles?

**Structure** - Legal entity? Governance? Formal incorporation?

**Partnerships** - What relationships need to be established? When?

**Assets and infrastructure** - Physical space? Equipment? Systems?

The organizational layer enables the business model layer. It's what needs to exist for your strategy to be executable.

### Toast Ale: Organizational Layer

The founders map their organizational needs across the timeline.

`[MAIN PANEL: Toast Ale organizational layer added below business model layer]`

**0-2 Months: Minimal Structure**

In the first two months, they keep it lean. Both founders are working part-time - nights and weekends while keeping their day jobs. They don't have a formal legal structure yet because they're not selling anything. They're brewing homebrew batches in one founder's kitchen. Their relationships with bakeries and bottle shops are informal - just conversations, building rapport.

This minimal structure works for customer discovery and research. They don't need more.

**2-6 Months: Building Capacity**

The pilot requires more structure. They bring in a brewing partner - a friend with commercial brewing experience who can help produce the five hundred bottle batch. He's working part-time too, but his expertise is critical.

They establish a legal entity now - probably an LLC or similar structure - because they're selling product and need legal protection. They formalize their bakery partnerships with actual contracts specifying bread collection schedules and logistics. They rent commercial brewing space for the pilot batch - they can't make five hundred bottles in a home kitchen.

One founder transitions to working three days a week on Toast Ale. The business is demanding more time.

The organizational layer is growing to match the business model demands.

**6-18 Months: Professional Operation**

To scale, they need professional capacity. One founder goes full-time - this is now their primary job. They hire their first employee focused on operations and logistics - someone to manage the growing complexity of bread collection, production coordination, and distribution.

They establish an ongoing partnership with a production brewery who has capacity they can rent. They're not buying their own equipment yet - that's too capital intensive - but they have reliable production capability.

They create formal governance - maybe a board of advisors or directors to provide oversight and guidance. And they build systems for tracking everything - sales, waste diversion, charity funding. They need data infrastructure now.

This is what a professional operation looks like. It's no longer a side project.

`[VISUAL TEXT: 0-2 = minimal | 2-6 = building capacity | 6-18 = professional operation]`

Notice how the organizational layer matches the business model layer. Each phase of validation and execution requires appropriate organizational support.

### Step 3: Building Your Capital Layer

Now the question is: Where does funding enter to make your organizational and business model strategies possible? You need to develop your Capital Strategy. 

Look at your first two layers and identify where you need capital to enable them.

**Inflection points** - These are moments when your business model validation creates a state change that makes you fundable. You've removed a big risk or proven something significant. This is when investors or funders can see your potential and are willing to put capital in.

Different capital sources make sense at different times:

**Bootstrap** - Your own savings, early revenue. Common at idea stage.

**Grants** - From foundations or government programs. Often good for impact-focused ventures.

**Friends and Family** - Small amounts from people who believe in you.

**Investors** - Larger amounts requiring equity or other terms. Usually need proof before they'll engage.

Identify your inflection points. Plan your capital strategy around them.

### Toast Ale: Capital Layer

The founders map where capital needs to enter.

`[MAIN PANEL: Toast Ale capital layer added below organizational layer, showing complete three-layer strategy]`

**0-2 Months: Bootstrap**

The first two months require about five thousand dollars. The founders cover this from personal savings. It pays for homebrew materials, travel to customer interviews and bakery visits, maybe some simple website hosting. The burn rate is minimal because both founders are still employed and working part-time.

No external capital needed yet. They're too early - no proof of concept. No investor or funder would be interested at this stage.

**6 Month Inflection Point: Pilot Results**

But if the two to six month pilot proves the model works - if conversion rates are good, if costs are manageable, if impact is measurable - something changes. They've created an inflection point.

Now they have proof. They can show data. Customer validation - people are buying the beer in retail environments. Economic validation - unit economics are positive at this scale. Impact validation - they're actually diverting bread from landfill and avoiding emissions.

This proof makes them fundable. Before the pilot, they had a nice idea. After the pilot, they have a validated business model. That's the difference that matters to funders and investors.

**6-18 Months: Small Round**

With that proof, they can raise about fifty thousand dollars. This might come from a small grant from an environmental foundation who likes their impact model. Or it might be a friends and family round - people who know the founders and believe in what they're building.

This capital enables the scale-up. They use it to increase production, hire their first employee, invest in marketing to build brand awareness, and create the systems they need to operate professionally. One founder goes full-time on this capital.

Without the six-month inflection point - without that pilot proof - they couldn't raise this money. With it, they can raise what they need without giving up significant ownership or control.

`[VISUAL TEXT: 0-2 = bootstrap | 6mo = inflection point | 6-18 = $50K raise]`

Notice the strategy here. They bootstrap to proof. Proof creates fundability. Then they raise just enough to scale to the next stage. They're not trying to raise a big round too early when they'd have to give up too much equity. They're being strategic about capital.

### How the Layers Interact

Here's the critical insight: These layers aren't built independently and then stacked. They interact and influence each other.

`[MAIN PANEL: Show arrows between layers indicating interaction]`

Your business model strategy might require organizational capacity you can't afford without capital. But you might not be able to raise capital until you've proven more of your business model.

This tension forces you to rethink your strategy. Maybe you need to reorder your business model validation so you can reach a fundable inflection point sooner. Or maybe you need to find a different organizational approach that requires less capital.

For Toast Ale, imagine they'd planned to buy their own brewing equipment in month three. That would cost $200,000. They can't bootstrap that much. And they won't be fundable at three months without proof.

So they revise: Instead of buying equipment, they partner with an existing brewery who has excess capacity. This removes the capital requirement until they're much further along and can justify a larger raise.

`[VISUAL TEXT: layers interact | constraints force creativity | test scenarios]`

The strategy model lets you test these scenarios. "What if we did X instead? How would that change the organizational and capital layers? Would that be better or worse?"

This is why the strategy model is such a powerful tool. It helps you see the whole system and optimize across all three layers.

1
00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:03,227
Start with your validation plans
from the previous sections.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,900
These experiments and activities
become your business model layer.

3
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:11,428
You're mapping them onto the timeline
and sequencing them logically.

4
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:14,219
Some experiments need
to happen before others.

5
00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:17,087
Customer discovery before
quantitative testing.

6
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,984
Impact model research
before running pilots.

7
00:00:20,164 --> 00:00:23,914
Certain economic assumptions can
only be tested after customer

8
00:00:23,914 --> 00:00:25,659
model assumptions are validated.

9
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:27,811
Work through the sequencing.

10
00:00:28,096 --> 00:00:29,446
What must come first?

11
00:00:29,744 --> 00:00:31,184
What can happen in parallel?

12
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:32,924
What are the dependencies?

13
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:35,268
Let's see what this
might have looked like.

14
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,884
For our to ale example,

15
00:00:37,513 --> 00:00:41,346
the founders take their validation
plans and map them across the timeline.

16
00:00:41,638 --> 00:00:42,748
Zero to two months.

17
00:00:42,778 --> 00:00:45,118
Customer discovery and impact research.

18
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:47,541
The first two months
are all about discovery.

19
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:52,128
They're running 20 to 30 customer
interviews with craft beer enthusiasts

20
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:56,078
to understand their jobs to be done
and test different value propositions.

21
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,111
At the same time, they're having 10
conversations with bakeries about

22
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:03,898
surplus bread, understanding volumes or
logistics and willingness to partner.

23
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:07,183
They're brewing small home
brew batches for taste tests.

24
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:09,283
Testing different positioning approaches.

25
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,782
Does beer made from surplus bread
work better than fighting food?

26
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:14,102
Waste one beer at a time.

27
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:16,108
They're learning the
language that resonates.

28
00:01:16,614 --> 00:01:18,714
On the impact side,
they're doing research.

29
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:22,331
What does the literature say about
food wastes environmental impact?

30
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:25,026
What are the emissions from
bread waste and landfills?

31
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:27,504
How much bread waste exists in the city?

32
00:01:27,857 --> 00:01:30,617
They're also talking to
environmental charities about

33
00:01:30,617 --> 00:01:32,147
potential partnership models.

34
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:37,162
These are mostly qualitative exploratory
activities, low cost high learning.

35
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:38,585
This is pure discovery.

36
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,577
Two to six months quantitative testing.

37
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,830
once they've completed custom
discovery and they understand what

38
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,000
resonates, they move to proof at scale.

39
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:50,034
They brew a larger batch, 500 bottles.

40
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:51,729
This isn't the Home Brew anymore.

41
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:55,393
They're partnering with a local brewery
to produce at commercial quality.

42
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:58,443
They place beer in 10 bottle
shops across the city.

43
00:01:58,449 --> 00:02:00,061
Now they're measuring real numbers.

44
00:02:00,214 --> 00:02:02,044
What's the shelf to
purchase conversion rate?

45
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:05,625
What does it actually cost to acquire
a customer through this channel?

46
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:09,100
Does the three pound per bottle
price point hold up when people

47
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,960
encounter it in a retail environment?

48
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:12,512
Are people coming back for more?

49
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:16,823
On the impact side, they're formalizing
partnerships with three bakeries.

50
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:20,242
They're collecting bread for three
months and measuring actual diversion.

51
00:02:20,362 --> 00:02:22,975
How much bread are they really
diverting from landfill?

52
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:25,868
They're piloting the
charity funding mechanism.

53
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,361
Do the economics allow them
to donate meaningful amounts?

54
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:32,030
This phase is about proving
that the insights from customer

55
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,025
discovery hold up with real numbers.

56
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,695
And six to 18 months scale and formalize
If the pilot proves that the model works,

57
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:45,149
if conversion rates are strong, if unit
economics are positive, if impact is

58
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:47,052
measurable, then they're ready to scale.

59
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:50,273
They move to producing
5,000 bottles per month.

60
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:52,994
They expand distribution
to 50 bottle shops.

61
00:02:53,154 --> 00:02:54,264
They're building a real brand.

62
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:58,558
Now using the sustainability story to
drive awareness, They formalize bakery

63
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:00,452
partnerships with actual contracts.

64
00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:04,161
they start to establish a rhythm
of charity funding based on profit.

65
00:03:04,826 --> 00:03:07,844
This is the transition from
validation to execution.

66
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:10,689
They're not just testing anymore,
they're building a business.

67
00:03:11,203 --> 00:03:13,788
This is the business model
layer of their strategy model.

68
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:17,417
It shows what they're validating
and building when and in what order.

69
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:23,125
Now ask what organizational pieces
need to be in place to execute

70
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:24,745
on this business model strategy.

71
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:29,262
For each phase of your timeline,
think through people who needs to

72
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:30,997
be involved part-time or full-time.

73
00:03:31,242 --> 00:03:35,399
What roles structure, legal
entity, governance, formal

74
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:37,308
incorporation, partnerships.

75
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:41,685
What relationships need to be established
When  assets and infrastructure,

76
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:46,512
physical space, equipment, systems,
software, The organizational layer

77
00:03:46,572 --> 00:03:48,072
enables the business model layer.

78
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:51,986
It's what needs to exist for
your strategy to be executable.

79
00:03:52,513 --> 00:03:56,953
So for Dale, the founders map their
organizational needs across the timeline,

80
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,309
zero to two months, minimal structure.

81
00:03:59,694 --> 00:04:00,864
In the first two months.

82
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:01,704
They keep it lean.

83
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:05,749
Both founders are working part-time nights
and weekends while keeping their jobs.

84
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:10,033
They don't have a formal legal structure
yet because they're not selling anything.

85
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:14,141
They're brewing home brew batches for
tastings in one of the founder's kitchens.

86
00:04:14,472 --> 00:04:18,582
Their relationships with bakeries and
bottle shops are just informal, just

87
00:04:18,582 --> 00:04:20,472
conversations and building rapport.

88
00:04:20,952 --> 00:04:24,297
This minimal structure works for
customer discovery and research.

89
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,350
They don't need more.

90
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:27,887
Two to six months building capacity.

91
00:04:28,254 --> 00:04:29,964
The pilot requires more structure.

92
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:34,022
They bring in a brewing partner, a friend
with commercial brewing experience who

93
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:36,302
can help produce the 500 bottle batch.

94
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:37,938
he's working part-time too.

95
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:39,713
But his expertise is critical.

96
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:43,558
They establish a legal entity,
probably an LLC, or similar

97
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:47,162
structure, because they're selling a
product, they need legal protection.

98
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:51,775
They formalize their bakery partnerships
with actual contracts, specifying bread

99
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:53,869
collection schedules and logistics.

100
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:57,130
They rent commercial brewing
space for the pilot batch.

101
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,230
They can't make 500 bottles
in a home kitchen and hit the

102
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,580
quality mark that they need.

103
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:05,379
One founder transitions to working
three days a week on toe ale.

104
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:07,208
The business is demanding more time.

105
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:11,191
The organizational layer is growing
to match the business model demands.

106
00:05:12,253 --> 00:05:17,260
Six to 18 months professional operation
to scale, they need professional capacity.

107
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:18,938
One founder goes full-time.

108
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:20,749
This is now their primary job.

109
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:25,080
They hire their first employee focused
on operations and logistics, someone

110
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,560
to manage the growing complexity
of breed collection, production,

111
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:30,377
coordination, and distribution.

112
00:05:30,577 --> 00:05:33,896
They establish an ongoing partnership
with a production brewery who

113
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:35,516
has capacity that they can rent.

114
00:05:35,744 --> 00:05:37,484
They're not buying
their own equipment yet.

115
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:42,013
That's too capital intensive,  But they
hire reliable production capability.

116
00:05:42,324 --> 00:05:46,101
They create formal governance, maybe
a board of advisors or directors

117
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:47,721
to provide oversight and guidance.

118
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:51,477
They build systems for tracking
everything, sales, waste,

119
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:53,185
diversion, charity funding.

120
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:54,871
They need data infrastructure.

121
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:57,818
Now, This is what a professional
operation looks like.

122
00:05:57,972 --> 00:05:59,622
It's no longer a side project.

123
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:03,584
Notice how the organization land
matches the business model layer.

124
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:07,853
Each phase of validation and
execution requires appropriate

125
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:08,933
organizational support.

126
00:06:09,763 --> 00:06:13,829
Now the question is, where does funding
enter to make your organizational and

127
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:15,599
business model strategies possible?

128
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:20,983
You need to develop a capital strategy,
look at the first two layers, and identify

129
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:22,723
where you need capital to enable them.

130
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:25,756
Identify inflection points.

131
00:06:25,883 --> 00:06:29,783
These are moments when your business
model validation creates a state

132
00:06:29,783 --> 00:06:31,602
change that makes you fundable.

133
00:06:32,034 --> 00:06:35,409
You've removed a big risk or
proven something significant.

134
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,808
This is when investors or funders can
see your potential and are willing to

135
00:06:39,808 --> 00:06:42,649
put capital in different capital sources.

136
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:46,949
Make sense at different times,
bootstrapping your own savings.

137
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:47,909
Early revenue.

138
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:53,105
This is common at Idea Stage Grants
from foundations or government programs,

139
00:06:53,315 --> 00:06:57,822
often good for impact focused ventures,
friends and family, small amounts of

140
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:59,562
investment from people who believe in you.

141
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:04,997
Investors, larger amounts requiring
equity or other terms, usually

142
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:06,887
need proof before they'll engage.

143
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,067
Identify your inflection points.

144
00:07:09,217 --> 00:07:11,257
Plan your capital strategy around them.

145
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:13,225
Let's look at toe stale.

146
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:17,087
The founder's map where the capital
needs to enter zero to two months.

147
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:21,213
Bootstrap,  The first two months
require about 5,000 pounds investment.

148
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:23,542
The founders cover this
from personal savings.

149
00:07:23,748 --> 00:07:25,667
It pays for home brew materials.

150
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:28,060
Travel to customer
interviews and bakery visits.

151
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:30,332
Maybe some simple website hosting.

152
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:34,605
The burn rate is minimal because founders
are still employed and working part time.

153
00:07:34,926 --> 00:07:36,876
No external capital is needed yet.

154
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:37,911
They're too early.

155
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:39,321
No proof of concept.

156
00:07:39,394 --> 00:07:42,274
No investor or funder would
be interested at this stage.

157
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,816
But if the two to six month pilot proves
the model works, if conversion rates

158
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:51,361
are good, if costs are manageable, if
impact is measurable, something changes.

159
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:53,041
They've created an inflection point.

160
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:56,786
Now they have proof they can
show data, customer validation.

161
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:59,366
People are buying the beer
and retail environments.

162
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:04,803
Economic validation, unity economics are
positive at the scale impact validation.

163
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:08,259
They're actually diverting bread
from landfill and avoiding emissions.

164
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,147
This proof makes them fund.

165
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,710
Before the pilot, they had a nice idea.

166
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:15,806
After the pilot, they have a
partially validated business model.

167
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,755
that's the difference that
matters to funders and investors.

168
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:22,315
with that proof, they could
raise about 50,000 pounds.

169
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:25,735
This might come from a small grant,
from an environmental foundation

170
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:28,962
who likes their impact model, Or it
might be a friends and family round.

171
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:31,482
People who know the founders and
believe in what they're building.

172
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:34,152
This capital enables 'em
to scale up somewhat.

173
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:36,035
They use it to increase production.

174
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:37,535
Hire their first employee.

175
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:39,811
Invest in marketing to
build brand awareness.

176
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:42,713
They create the systems they
need to operate professionally.

177
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:47,021
One founder goes full time on this
capital without the six month inflection

178
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:50,978
point, without the pilot proof, they
couldn't raise this money With it, they

179
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:54,608
can raise what they need without giving
up significant ownership or control.

180
00:08:55,274 --> 00:08:56,621
Notice the strategy here.

181
00:08:56,895 --> 00:08:58,272
They bootstrapped to proof.

182
00:08:58,452 --> 00:09:01,901
Proof creates fundability, and
then they raise just enough

183
00:09:01,993 --> 00:09:03,458
to scale to the next stage.

184
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,679
They're not trying to raise a
big round too early when they'd

185
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,179
have to give up too much equity.

186
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:09,438
They're being strategic about capital.

187
00:09:10,478 --> 00:09:12,366
These layers aren't built independently.

188
00:09:12,366 --> 00:09:14,346
They interact and influence each other.

189
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,600
Your business model strategy might
require organizational capacity that

190
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,220
you can't afford without capital.

191
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,787
but you might not be able to
raise capital until you've proven

192
00:09:23,787 --> 00:09:25,077
more of your business model.

193
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:27,971
This tension forces you
to rethink your strategy.

194
00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:31,976
Maybe you need to reorder your business
model validation so that you can reach

195
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:33,956
a fundable inflection point sooner.

196
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:37,436
Or maybe you need to find a
different organizational approach

197
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:38,726
that requires less capital.

198
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:42,242
For tow stale, imagine that
they'd plan to buy their own

199
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:44,108
brewing equipment in month three.

200
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:46,933
That would cost, say, 200,000 pounds.

201
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:50,036
They can't bootstrap that
much,  and they won't be fundable

202
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:51,446
at three months without proof.

203
00:09:51,818 --> 00:09:52,864
So they revise.

204
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:55,594
Instead of buying equipment,
they partner with an existing

205
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:57,554
brewery who has excess capacity.

206
00:09:57,788 --> 00:10:01,660
This removes the capital requirement
until they're much further along and

207
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,700
can justify a larger capital raise.

208
00:10:04,755 --> 00:10:07,515
The strategy model lets
you test these scenarios.

209
00:10:07,684 --> 00:10:09,244
What if we did X instead?

210
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:12,424
How would this change the
organizational and capital layers?

211
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:14,288
Would that be better or worse?

212
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:17,579
This is why the strategy
model is such a powerful tool.

213
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:21,794
It helps you see the whole system
and optimize across the three layers.
