## 1. Description

Buy Me Once is an online shopping website founded in 2016 by former advertising executive Tara Button, inspired by the durability and design of a Le Creuset cooking pot she had received as a gift. The website stocks more than 2,000 products and operates in both the UK and US markets. Buy Me Once researches and sells durable, long-lasting kitchenware and homeware products with the mission to change consumer behavior from short-term throwaway buying to longer-term, mindful purchasing. The company only sells products they can stand behind, developing meaningful relationships with makers and offering exclusive warranties.

This purpose extends beyond just selling products to fundamentally transforming consumer behavior toward sustainability.

## 4. Impact Model

#### Issue

**Issue Detailed Analysis**: The core issue is throwaway consumer culture driven by planned obsolescence and marketing manipulation, contributing significantly to environmental destruction. Most environmental damage occurs during manufacture and distribution, so repeated purchases multiply carbon emissions. This system creates both environmental waste and financial burden for consumers caught in cycles of replacement purchasing.

**Issue Synopsis**: Throwaway consumer culture driven by planned obsolescence creates environmental waste and financial burden.

#### Participants

**Participants Detailed Analysis**: Key stakeholders include environmentally conscious consumers seeking alternatives, manufacturers committed to durability and repairability, the Buy Me Once team conducting research and curation, and the broader community of users sharing knowledge about long-lasting products. The platform has created "the most knowledgeable and helpful group of people" focused on durable goods.

**Participants Synopsis**: Conscious consumers, durable goods manufacturers, Buy Me Once research team, and product longevity community.

#### Activities

**Activities Detailed Analysis**: Core activities include rigorous product research using a five-question evaluation process, building relationships with manufacturers to secure exclusive warranties, educating consumers about durability through content and community building, and promoting mindful consumption through speaking engagements and Tara's book "A Life Less Throwaway".

**Activities Synopsis**: Product research and curation, manufacturer partnerships, consumer education, and community building around durability.

#### Outcomes Chain

**Short-Term Outcomes**: Customers purchase higher-quality, longer-lasting products instead of disposable alternatives; increased awareness of planned obsolescence and sustainable alternatives.

**Medium-Term Outcomes**: Reduced frequency of replacement purchases leading to cost savings; decreased household waste; improved consumer satisfaction with durable goods; growing community of conscious consumers.

**Long-Term Outcomes**: Significant reduction in manufacturing and distribution impact through decreased repeat purchases; industry shift toward durability and repairability standards; cultural change in consumer behavior toward mindful purchasing.

**Outcomes Detailed Analysis**: The outcomes progress from individual purchasing behavior change to broader cultural and industry transformation, ultimately creating a cascade effect where durable goods become the norm rather than the exception.

**Short-Term Outcomes Synopsis**: Customers choose durable over disposable products, increasing sustainability awareness.

**Medium-Term Outcomes Synopsis**: Reduced replacement frequency, decreased waste, improved satisfaction, growing conscious community.  

**Long-Term Outcomes Synopsis**: Industry shift toward durability standards and cultural change toward mindful consumption.

#### Impact

**Impact Detailed Analysis**: The ultimate impact is transforming global consumer culture from throwaway to "buy once" mentality, significantly reducing environmental damage from manufacturing and waste. As Tara notes, if products lasted just 19% longer, companies like Walmart could meet all sustainability targets. This represents a fundamental shift toward circular economy principles and sustainable living.
