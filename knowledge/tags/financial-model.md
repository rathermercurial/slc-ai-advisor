# financial-model

The revenue and cost components of your economic model come together to form the beginnings of your financial model. This shows the way that money works for your enterprise at scale. This is about proving that the revenue that you get from your customers will be enough to cover the cost of delivering your product or service to your customers, as well as the cost of delivering the activities that your impact model requires. This will show that your business model works as a single whole integrated system. That all of the pieces come together to create something that can at least sustain itself and turn a profit if that's your goal. In this first pass through the canvas, start by listing your business model's main revenue and cost items.
