# Existing Alternatives

**Quick Definition**: Current solutions or competitors addressing the same jobs customers need done - validates market need and reveals competitive landscape.

**Key Insight**: Include "doing nothing" as an alternative - if customers aren't currently trying to solve the problem, they may not really care about it.

**Full Documentation**: [[../agent-content/canvas-sections/customer-model/jobs-to-be-done/existing-alternatives/existing-alternatives|Complete Existing Alternatives Guide]]
