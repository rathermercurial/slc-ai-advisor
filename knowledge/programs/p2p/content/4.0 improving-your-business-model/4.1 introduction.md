<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
Now you've mapped out your business model in the Social Lean Canvas. You need to answer a critical question: is it actually good enough to work on?

People spend years struggling away on business models that weren't never good enough to execute on. 
Better to find this out early and fix it before you spend time, money and effort on it.

**Tag line:** **Good enough to test?**

### What Makes It Good Enough?

**[MAIN PANEL: Business model design framework diagram from section 3.1]**

Back in Understanding Business Model Design, we outlined what a good business model looks like.

Your **Customer Model** has to have the potential to reach product-market fit. Clear customers with real jobs to be done. Value propositions they can't resist. Solutions that deliver.

Your **Impact Model** needs to deliver impact - both micro and macro. Short-term measurable outcomes. Long-term systemic change.

Your **Economic Model** needs to show positive unit economics and the potential for growth. Revenue exceeds costs. Path to sustainability.

You're not building a unicorn. You're building something sustainable at your scale. But the fundamentals still apply.

**Tag line:** **Three models work together.**

### What This Module Covers

**[MAIN PANEL: Return to full Social Lean Canvas with Customer, Impact, Economic sections highlighted in sequence]**

In this module, we'll walk through how to analyze each of these three models. We'll assess whether they're strong enough. And if not, we'll work through how to improve them.

We'll tackle the Customer Model first. Then the Impact Model. Then the Economic Model.

For each one, we'll continue this back and forth with the core social lean canvas content, you'll see the Core Framework on how to assess and improve, then we'll come back and talk about what this means for P2P ventures like yours.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Customer → Impact → Economic]**

You'll constantly learn, iterate, and improve your business model as you go. But you need to start from a solid foundation. This section is about building that solid starting foundation. 

**Tag line:** **Build on solid ground.**

### The Machine You're Building

**[MAIN PANEL: Simple system diagram showing Customer Model → Impact Model → Economic Model flowing together]**

Quick reminder. You're building a machine. A system that creates value for customers, delivers meaningful impact, and generates sustainable economics.

All three models need to work together. They're not separate - they're interconnected.

A strong customer model affects your economics. Efficient impact activities reduce costs. Better economics let you serve more customers and deliver more impact.

This systematic improvement work - right now - is how you make sure the machine you're building will actually work.

**[VISUAL TEXT: System, not pieces | All connected]**

**Tag line:** **Build the machine right.**

### Let's Begin

**[MAIN PANEL: Transition to Customer Model section]**

Time to get systematic. We'll start with your Customer Model.

Let's see if it's strong enough to get you to product-market fit - and if not, how to make it better.
