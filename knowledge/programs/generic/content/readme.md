## Using This README

### For the AI Advisor

**Finding Content by Module Number:**

- `2.0` → Introduction and program overview
- `3.1.X` → Business model fundamentals (concepts, theory)
- `3.2.X` → Canvas completion (practical guidance for each section)
- `4.X.X` → Improvement process (assessment → levers → iteration)
- `5.1.X` → Validation planning (stage assessment + validation plans)
- `5.2.X` → Strategy building (integration + roadmap)

**Finding Content by Canvas Section:**
Use tags to locate section-specific content:

- Purpose: `3.2.1`
- Customer Model (Customers, JTBD, UVP, Solution): `3.2.2`, `4.2.X`
- Impact Model: `3.2.3`, `4.3.X`
- Economic Model (Channels, Revenue, Costs, Advantage): `3.2.4`, `4.4.X`
- Key Metrics: `3.2.5`

**Finding Content by User Need:**

- "I need to understand business models" → `3.1.X`
- "I'm filling in my canvas" → `3.2.X`
- "I want to improve my customer model" → `4.2.X`
- "I need to validate my impact" → `5.1.5`
- "I'm building my strategy" → `5.2.X`

**Content Progression:**

1. Foundational concepts (`3.1`) before canvas creation (`3.2`)
2. Complete canvas (`3.2`) before improvement (`4.0`)
3. Improve model (`4.0`) before validation planning (`5.1`)
4. Validation plans (`5.1`) before strategy integration (`5.2`)

### For Human Maintainers

**Adding New Content:**

- Determine appropriate module level (avoid going deeper than 4 levels)
- Use consistent file naming: `[Number] [kebab-case-title].md`
- Add frontmatter with title and relevant tags
- Update this README if adding new major modules

**Module Organization Principles:**

- Top-level (X.0): Program or major topic overview
- Second-level (X.Y): Sub-program or major concept
- Third-level (X.Y.Z): Specific canvas sections or sub-topics
- Fourth-level (X.Y.Z.N): Detailed breakdowns (use sparingly)
