## Section 5.1.4: Validating Your Customer Model

**Tag line: "Prove customers will pay"**

### Why Start Here

We start with customer model validation because your customer model is the engine of your business model.

`[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas - highlight Customer Model section]`

Without customers who will pay for your solution, nothing else can work. If you can create value for customers, there's a lot you can potentially change about your impact and economic models to evolve your business model into something that works.

But without an engine of value creation - without customers with important jobs to be done, who will engage with your unique value proposition and pay for your solution - you don't have much.

As a result, the biggest and most fundamental risk in your business model is very often that your customer model won't work.

### Building on Your Module 4 Work

In improving your business model , you worked through improving your customer model. You defined your beachhead segment. You calculated TAM times ARPU. You clarified the flow from customer segment to job to be done to unique value proposition to solution.

And critically, you identified the riskiest assumptions in your customer model.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Module 4 = improve model | Module 5 = prove it works]`

Now you're going to figure out to validate those assumptions. You're going to test whether what you believe about your customers is actually true.

### Customer Discovery: The Qualitative Phase

Customer Discovery is the first phase of validating your customer model. It's the qualitative journey into learning what you don't already know about your customers and evolving your customer model based on this learning.

`[MAIN PANEL: Customer Model section with components highlighted]`

You'll validate assumptions across all the components of your customer model. Let's walk through them.

**Customers and Early Adopters** - Are you targeting the right segment? Can you actually reach them? Where are your early adopters within this segment? What connects them?

**Jobs to be Done** - Is this job as important as you think? How are they currently trying to get it done? What's the pain when it doesn't work?

**Existing Alternatives** - What are they really using today? What would they have to give up to use your solution? What switching costs exist?

**Unique Value Proposition** - Does your value proposition resonate? Are you using the right language? Does it solve what they actually care about?

**Solution** - Is your solution the right way to deliver this value? What features matter most? What's missing?

`[VISUAL TEXT: customers | JTBD | alternatives | UVP | solution]`

The most powerful tool you have for Customer Discovery is the customer interview. Find people who fit your early adopter category and have structured conversations with them to explore these assumptions.

### How to Approach Customer Interviews

Keep these conversations open. Be an anthropologist. Don't pitch. Explore.

Don't ask "Do you struggle with X?" or "Will you pay X dollars for my product?" Instead, discover the need, pain, and motivation that will cause a customer to want to buy your product.

Ask them to walk you through how they navigate the use case you're aiming to help them with. Let them surface what's difficult about this. Ask them how they're currently solving the problems that come up.

`[VISUAL TEXT: don't pitch | explore | let them surface problems]`

This un-led exploration is the rich learning opportunity because you're hearing what they actually think, not shaped by what you want to hear.

If they don't mention the problem you're trying to solve for them, you can nudge them to explore that. But if nothing strong is emerging from the customer - this is really valuable information. It might mean you're not yet on the right track.

### Toast Ale: Customer Discovery Journey

Let's see what this looked like for our hypothetical Toast Ale founders at idea stage.

Remember, they're trying to validate assumptions about craft beer drinkers who care about sustainability. But they don't know yet if "surplus bread beer" will have stigma attached, what price point will work, or where people will buy it.

`[MAIN PANEL: Toast Ale customer model with assumption areas highlighted]`

**Validating Customers and Early Adopters**

They start by having conversations with craft beer enthusiasts at local bottle shops and beer festivals. They're exploring: Who cares most about sustainability in beer? What connects these people? Where do they hang out?

They discover a segment of environmentally conscious craft beer drinkers who are already seeking out sustainable brands. These people talk about carbon footprint, local sourcing, and brand values. The founders identify that the most passionate early adopters are people already buying from breweries with environmental missions.

**Validating Jobs to be Done and Existing Alternatives**

In conversations, they ask: "How do you think about environmental impact when you're choosing beer? What brands do you associate with sustainability?"

They learn that people want to feel good about their beer choices. They're already choosing organic beers, local breweries, and brands with environmental commitments. But food waste hasn't been a dimension people considered before.

**Validating Unique Value Proposition**

They test different framings of the value proposition. "Beer made from surplus bread." "Fighting food waste one beer at a time." "Award-winning beer that saves bread from landfill."

They discover that "waste bread" doesn't create stigma - it creates curiosity. People find the story compelling. The connection between bread and beer - both grains - makes intuitive sense. And the environmental angle resonates strongly.

**Validating Solution**

They bring homebrew samples to tastings. They watch reactions. They see if people come back for seconds.

They discover the beer needs to taste as good as premium craft beer - the sustainability angle won't carry a mediocre product. But when the beer is excellent, the surplus bread story becomes a powerful differentiator.

`[VISUAL TEXT: curiosity not stigma | story creates value | quality critical]`

Through twenty to thirty deep conversations and tastings, the founders evolve their understanding. They're not just validating - they're discovering insights that make the model stronger.

### Moving to Quantitative Validation

Once you've learned and evolved your customer model through Customer Discovery, it's time to develop quantitative experiments to test your customer model at scale.

`[MAIN PANEL: Transition from qualitative to quantitative]`

You're not discovering new insights anymore. You're proving that what you learned in qualitative validation works at the scale your business model requires.

### Types of Quantitative Experiments

Different experiments test different assumptions:

**Landing pages and pre-orders** - Test whether your value proposition converts at scale. Does the messaging that worked in conversations work online?

**Concierge MVP** - Deliver your solution manually at small scale. Proves people will use it and pay for it before you build infrastructure.

**Pilot sales through specific channels** - Test whether your channels can actually reach enough customers. What's the conversion rate? What's the cost to acquire a customer?

**Small batch production** - If you're making a physical product, produce a limited run and sell it through real channels.

`[VISUAL TEXT: landing pages | concierge MVP | pilot sales | small batches]`

These experiments start proving your economic model too. You're testing pricing, channels, and customer acquisition costs. This is why customer validation comes first - it unlocks economic validation.

### Toast Ale: Quantitative Validation

For Toast Ale, quantitative validation means proving the insights from Customer Discovery work at scale.

The founders brew a larger batch - five hundred bottles. They want to test whether the positioning that worked in tastings will work when people encounter the beer in a retail environment.

`[MAIN PANEL: Toast Ale bottle shop pilot setup]`

They place the beer in ten bottle shops across the city. They track:

**Acquisition and Activation** - How many people stop to look at the bottle? How many pick it up? How many buy? What's the conversion rate from "sees it" to "buys it"?

**Revenue** - Will people pay five dollars for a bottle? Is this price point sustainable across different customer segments?

**Channel effectiveness** - Do bottle shops work as a channel? What's the cost to get the beer into shops? How quickly does it move off shelves?

**Retention signals** - Do people come back for more? Do they ask retailers to stock it regularly?

The data either confirms their Customer Discovery insights or reveals gaps that need addressing.

If the conversion rate matches what they saw in tastings, they're onto something. If it's significantly lower, they need to understand why and iterate.

### Designing Your Validation Plan

Now take your risky assumptions from Module 4 and design specific experiments to test them.

For each assumption, ask:

What's the fastest, cheapest way to test this?

How can I test actual behavior, not stated preferences?

What would prove this assumption wrong? Be clear on your success criteria before you run the experiment.

Which assumptions are existential? Test those first.

`[VISUAL TEXT: fastest/cheapest | actual behavior | clear criteria | existential first]`

**Create your validation plan document.** List your experiments in priority order, starting with the riskiest assumptions. For each experiment, document:

- What assumption(s) it tests
- How you'll run it (method, participants, scale)
- Success criteria (what proves it right or wrong)
- Timeline and resources needed

**Sequence your experiments appropriately:**
- Start with Customer Discovery (qualitative interviews and exploration)
- Move to quantitative scale testing only after discovery insights are clear
- Note dependencies - some experiments require insights from earlier experiments

This plan becomes your input for building your strategy model.
