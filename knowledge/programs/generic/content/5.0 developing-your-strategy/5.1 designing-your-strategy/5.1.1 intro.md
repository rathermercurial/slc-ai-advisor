## Section 5.1.1: Introduction

**Tag line: "From model to action"**

### Bridge from Improving Business Model

You've done the hard work. You've assessed your customer model, your impact model, and your economic model. You've identified weaknesses and strengthened them. You've moved beyond back-of-napkin thinking.

You now have one or more business models that are good enough to test.

So what's next?

Now you need strategy. You need to turn your business model into action.

### Why Strategy Matters

Strategy is what directs your time, effort, and money into the most important and valuable activities.

Missing on strategy is just as bad as missing on business model design.

There are a million ways to burn time, money, and effort going in the wrong direction and getting nowhere. Threading a path for your venture through all the potential missteps - that's the job of good strategy.


## Strategy as a living process

It is also important for strategy to be a flexible and evolving process. Because you will be constantly evolving your business model as you validate it, you will constantly evolve your strategy as well. Developing your strategy can't be about creating a giant document that everyone will blindly follow. It needs to be a flexible and evolving process that any any point in time captures your best path forward in your current reality. 

The strategy model is designed to be a living document that you constantly update as you learn and iterate your business model.

### The Validation Journey

You'll recall from the module on business model design that the journey from untested business model idea to successful venture is one of validation and iteration.

Taking untested assumptions in your business model, testing them, and then evolving the business model as you learn.

This journey is what your strategy will map. It will make sure you're taking sensible next steps and not wasting your time and money on useless activities.


### What This Module Covers

In this module, we'll work through three key steps:

First, assessing the stage of your venture's development. Understanding where you are on the journey.

Second, validation. How to develop a plan to validate the riskiest parts of your business model.

And third, building your strategy. Wrapping all this up into a strategy that covers what you're going to do, how you're going to do it, and what funding you'll need and when to make this possible.

To make this concrete, we'll follow an example throughout. We'll use a fictional early-stage version of Toast Ale - a purpose-driven brewery that makes beer from surplus bread to fight food waste.

This isn't their actual history. We're imagining what their journey might have looked like at the idea stage. Think of this as a case study to help you understand the process.

Let's get started.
