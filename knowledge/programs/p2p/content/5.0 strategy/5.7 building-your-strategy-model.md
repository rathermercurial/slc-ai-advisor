**[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas with validation plans highlighted]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
You're about to work through the Core content on building your complete strategy model. This brings your validation plans together into an execution roadmap.

The Core Framework walks through the business model layer, organizational layer, and capital layer, showing how they interact across a 2/6/18 month timeline.

**[VISUAL TEXT: 3 layers | 2/6/18 timeline | Team example]**

Pay attention to how the layers work together as a system. After the Core content, we'll show you how to build this at P2P scale 

**Tag line:** **Three layers, one system.**

## P2P COMMENTARY

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Strategy at PPV Scale"]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
Now that you've worked through the Core Framework on building your strategy model, let's talk about what this looks like when you're bootstrapping solo or with a tiny team.

**Tag line:** **Adapt to your scale.**

---

### Strategy at P2P Scale

**[MAIN PANEL: Side-by-side comparison - Social enterprise/startup scale vs PPV scale]**

It's the same three layers. Same framework. Different scale.

The Core Framework applies to all purpose-driven ventures - including social enterprises and high-growth startups with teams and external funding. As a Purpose Pivot Venture you might be solo only have access to a few thousand dollars from savings, or no money at all. Those ventures might raise capital early. You might bootstrap indefinitely.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Team + funding vs Solo + bootstrap | Both valid approaches]**

The strategy approach is universal but execution adapts to your constraints.

As before your constraints help bring clarity. They force focus. They narrow your options to what actually works at your scale. They push you toward creative solutions you wouldn't have considered if you had unlimited resources.

**Tag line:** **Constraints drive creativity.**

---

### Timeline Flexibility

**[MAIN PANEL: Timeline comparison showing stretched PPV version]**

The Core Framework showed a 2/6/18 month timeline. That's ideal for early-stage ventures making this their full-time focus.

For a P2P venture, timelines might need stretch. If you're still employed and  working on this part-time. Your 2/6/18 might become 3/9/24 or even longer. On the other hand, if you are doing something comparatively simple, you might accelerate your timeline into something like 1/3/9. Feel into what suits your situation best.  


**[VISUAL TEXT: Still employed = validation time | No rush to revenue | Stronger proof]**

If you can take time for thorough validation because you're not burning through investor capital with a clock ticking. You can do more and deeper customer discovery and not commit yourself to a particular direction until you really know you are on the right track. 

If you're not sure what the right timeline is for your venture, stick with our 2/6/18 month starting point for now. 



**Tag line:** Pick the pace that works for you.**
 

---

### Organizational Layer Stays Lean

**[MAIN PANEL: Organizational layer comparison]**



For P2P ventures, the organizational layer often stays minimal much longer.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Solo longer | Contractors vs employees | Cloud tools]**

You might be the whole organization through early stage and into growth stage. When you do bring in help, it's often contractors for specific functions rather than employees. Your infrastructure often stays cloud-based and lean - Notion for docs, cloud hosting, SaaS tools instead of building custom systems.

**[VISUAL TEXT: LYT example | Solo + cloud tools | No formal structure needed]**

When might you bring in first help? Often when a specific bottleneck emerges that you can clearly delegate. DesignJoy might have brought in a contractor when design requests consistently exceeded what one person could deliver. Plausible Analytics will have eventually hired for customer support and infrastructure management.

But you don't need to plan for this in your 0-2 month timeline. Keep the organizational layer minimal until the business model layer demands more.



**Tag line:** **Stay lean longer.**

---

### Capital Layer: Bootstrap Paths

**[MAIN PANEL: Capital layer comparison]**


Many P2P ventures bootstrap through early stage - they make the finances work with savings and spending income. Some bootstrap to profitability and never raise external capital. Others may take small amounts of funding. Depending on the type of venture this could be in the form of a grant, maybe friends and family invest, they do a small angel investment round, take out a bank loan or something else. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Many bootstrap fully | Some raise small amounts | Both work]**

Your capital strategy layer might look like this:

**0-6 Months: Bootstrap**

Maybe $5K from savings. Covers hosting, tools, small experiments, venue rental for in-real-life experiments. Your burn rate is minimal because you're still employed. You're not paying yourself. Infrastructure costs are low.

No external capital needed yet. You're early. And that's fine - you're not trying to raise anything.

**[MAIN PANEL: Bootstrap runway visualization]**

**6-12 Month Inflection Point: First Revenue**

If your validation proves the model works, something changes. You have paying customers. You have proof that people will buy. Your unit economics are positive.

This might be your inflection point. Perhaps for raising capital or perhaps just for deciding whether to transition into working on it full-time


**[VISUAL TEXT: Proof point | Funding point | Decision point]**

**12-24 Months: Operating Revenue**

If you're growing, you might be funding that growth from revenue. Each month's income funds next month's expenses and small investments in growth. You're building a sustainable machine.

You might bring in a small amount of external capital at some point - maybe to accelerate something specific, maybe to smooth cash flow during a growth phase. 

But many P2P ventures often reach profitability without ever raising anything.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Revenue funds growth | Sustainable pace | Optional external capital]**

Your capital strategy reflects your goals. If you want to stay small and profitable, you might never raise anything. If you want to scale significantly, you might bring in capital once you have strong proof. Both are legitimate paths.

**Tag line:** **Revenue funds growth.**

---

### Your Turn: Create Your Strategy Model

**[MAIN PANEL: Blank strategy model template]**

You have everything you need to build your strategy model.

Follow the process from the Core Framework. Take your validation plans from sections from the validation sections for customer, impact and economic models and map them across your three layers and timeline.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Follow Core process | Adapt to your scale | Balance priorities]**

The key for ventures like yours is to weigh your priorities carefully. Balance what your venture needs against your personal circumstances. If you're still employed, your timeline can stretch. If you're bootstrapping, your organizational layer stays minimal longer.

Strike the balance that actually works for your situation. The framework is universal. Your execution is yours.

layer, and capital layer, showing
you how they interact across a

1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:02,840
Now that you've walked through the
core framework on building your

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,899
strategy model, let's talk about
what it looks like when you're

3
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:08,329
bootstrapping solo or with a tiny team.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,190
As always, the core framework applies to
all purpose driven ventures, including

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,720
social enterprises and high growth
startups with teams and external funding.

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,382
As a P two P venture, you may be solo
and only have access to a few thousand

7
00:00:22,382 --> 00:00:26,459
dollars from savings, or maybe you've
got no money at all to spend Other

8
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,259
ventures might raise capital early.

9
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:32,766
You might bootstrap and definitely
The strategy approach is universal,

10
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:36,295
but your execution needs to
adapt to your constraints.

11
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:40,074
As before, your constraints
help bring clarity.

12
00:00:40,392 --> 00:00:41,652
They force focus.

13
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:45,080
They narrow your options to what
actually works at your scale.

14
00:00:45,758 --> 00:00:49,358
They push you towards creative solutions
that you wouldn't have considered

15
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:51,518
if you had unlimited resources.

16
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:56,845
The core framework showed a
two, six and 18 month timeline.

17
00:00:56,995 --> 00:01:00,041
This is ideal for early stage
ventures, making this their

18
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:04,276
full-time focus For P two P ventures,
timelines might need to stretch.

19
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:09,055
If you're still employed working on this
part-time, you are two, six, and 18.

20
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:12,513
Might become three, nine
and 24 or even longer.

21
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,898
On the other hand, if you're doing
something comparatively simple, you

22
00:01:16,898 --> 00:01:20,438
might accelerate your timelines into
something like one, three, and nine.

23
00:01:20,722 --> 00:01:23,512
Feel into what suits your situation best.

24
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:28,128
If you can take time for thorough
validation because you're not burning

25
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:32,382
through investor capital with a clock
ticking, you can do much deeper customer

26
00:01:32,382 --> 00:01:36,960
discovery and not commit yourself to a
particular direction until you really

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,460
know that you're on the right track.

28
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:42,480
If you're not sure what the right
timeline is for your venture, stick

29
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,524
with two, six and 18 month as a starting
point, and then figure it out as you go.

30
00:01:47,564 --> 00:01:52,203
. For P two P Ventures, the organization
layer often stays minimal, much longer.

31
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:56,715
You might be the whole organization
through early stage and into growth stage.

32
00:01:56,964 --> 00:02:00,605
when you do bring in help, it's
often contractors for specific

33
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:02,405
functions rather than employees.

34
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:02,480
Okay.

35
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:06,655
Your infrastructure often stays
cloud-based and lean notion for

36
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:10,907
docs cloud hosting SaaS tools
instead of building custom systems.

37
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:13,931
So how do you know when you
should bring in first help?

38
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:18,371
Often when a specific bottleneck
emerges that you can clearly delegate.

39
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:22,424
It's the right time Design joy might
have bought in a contractor when

40
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:25,724
design requests consistently exceeded
what one person could deliver.

41
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:29,744
Plausible analytics will have
eventually hired for customer

42
00:02:29,744 --> 00:02:32,624
support and infrastructure
management when they got big enough.

43
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:37,575
But you don't need to plan for this in
your first zero to two month timeline.

44
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,618
Keep the organizational layer
minimal until the business

45
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,938
model layer demands more.

46
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:45,902
Many P two P ventures
bootstrap through early stage.

47
00:02:46,386 --> 00:02:49,896
They make the finances work with
savings and spending income.

48
00:02:50,106 --> 00:02:53,946
Some bootstrap to profitability
and never raise external capital.

49
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:57,844
Others may take small amounts of funding
Depending on the type of venture,

50
00:02:58,054 --> 00:03:00,214
this could be in the form of a grant.

51
00:03:00,604 --> 00:03:05,884
Maybe friends and family invest or they
do a small angel investment round or

52
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:07,774
take out a bank loan or something else.

53
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,960
Your capital strategy layer might look
like this, zero to six months bootstrap,

54
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,713
maybe 5K from savings covers hosting
tools, small experiments, venue rental.

55
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:22,834
For in real life experiments, your burn
rate is minimal because you're still

56
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,747
employed, you're not paying yourself.

57
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:26,323
Infrastructure costs are low.

58
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:28,897
No external capital needed yet.

59
00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:30,817
You're early and that's fine.

60
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:32,617
You're not trying to raise anything.

61
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:37,808
Then at six to 12 months, If your
validation proves the model works,

62
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:42,315
something changes, like you have paying
customers, you have proof that people want

63
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:44,985
to buy your unity economics are positive.

64
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:49,584
This might be your inflection point,
perhaps for raising capital, or perhaps

65
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:53,201
just for deciding whether to transition
into working on  venture full time.

66
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:57,835
Then 12 to 24 months operating revenue.

67
00:03:58,148 --> 00:04:01,240
If you're growing, you might be
funding that growth from revenue.

68
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,540
Each month's income funds,
the next month's expenses.

69
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,078
With a small investment in
growth, you're building a

70
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:08,278
sustainable machine at this point.

71
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:12,459
You might bring in a small amount
of external capital at some point,

72
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,930
maybe to accelerate something
specific, maybe to smooth out

73
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,730
cash flow during a growth phase.

74
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:22,471
But many P two P ventures often reach
profitability without raising anything.

75
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:25,294
Your capital strategy reflects your goals.

76
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:29,216
If you want to stay small and
profitable, you might never raise money.

77
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:32,828
If you want to scale significantly,
you might bring in capital.

78
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:35,729
Once you have strong proof,
both the legitimate paths,

79
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:40,335
you have everything you need to
build your strategy model, follow

80
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:42,225
the process from the core framework.

81
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:46,208
Take your validation plans from the
validation sections for customer

82
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:51,166
impact and economic models and map them
across your three layers and timeline.

83
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:55,652
The key for a venture like yours is
to weigh your priorities carefully

84
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:59,732
Balance what your venture needs
against your personal circumstances.

85
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:02,809
If you're still employed,
your timeline can stretch.

86
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:07,096
If you're bootstrapping, your
organizational layer stays minimal longer.

87
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:10,233
Strike the balance that actually
works for your situation.

88
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:12,502
The framework is universal.

89
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:14,512
Your execution is yours.
