# Strategic Improvement Approaches

Now let's look at how to improve your impact model. Here are five strategic approaches.

### Copy from Others

If you're trying to address a real problem, you don't have to do all of this from scratch.

Many organizations will have already approached each piece of your impact model before. Perhaps in different communities or geographies. Look at how they're approaching the issue. There will be many angles on how you could do this.


And if you don't understand something, call them up and ask. They'll usually be happy to talk through what they've learned and give you advice.

Use AI research tools to find:

Who's already doing similar work? What approaches are they taking? What seems to be working? What hasn't worked? Where the struggles have been?

What academic research, longitudinal studies, or evaluation reports prove aspects of your impact logic?

`[VISUAL TEXT: who's doing this? | what works? | what proves it?]`

This research can put your impact model on a solid footing and save you from guessing wildly about what might work.

### Find Leverage Points in the System

If you can map the system that the issue is occurring in, you can look for leverage points in different parts of it.

You might find that intervening earlier, or in an adjacent part of the system, will be much more effective.

This is where complexity thinking helps. Small interventions in the right places create outsized change.

The domestic violence example showed this - employment intervention upstream was more effective than victim support downstream.

Toast Ale shows it too - intervening at the food waste recovery point rather than trying to change consumer behavior at the end of the chain.

Where in your system are the high-leverage intervention points?

### Partner to Reduce Load

Having a robust approach to impact can take a lot of work and focus. Consider how you might partner with other organizations to reduce some of this load from your business model.

Perhaps you could team up with an organization that's already delivering the activities you plan to deliver. You could fund them to expand their activities rather than do it yourself.

Perhaps you could partner with an organization that's holding one piece of a solution while you hold another piece. Collectively you might be more effective and also reduce costs.

When does it make sense to partner versus do it yourself? If your impact activities are core to your value proposition or competitive advantage, you probably need to do them yourself. If they're necessary but don't make your model, partnership might work better.

And remember the connection to your economic model. Partnership can dramatically reduce your cost structure.

### Stay Experimental and Flexible

Accept that you won't have all the answers. Like with the rest of the business model, you'll discover them in time through experimentation.

Don't lock down your impact model prematurely. You need to be able to respond to learning and pivot the impact model when you discover something that will be more effective.

Keep it light enough to be able to evolve it.

The balance is: enough structure to test your assumptions, enough flexibility to pivot when you learn something new.

### Prioritization Framework

You've just seen five approaches. Which should you use when?

Start with "copy from others." Learn from existing work. Don't reinvent what's already been figured out.

Then use the "systems lens and leverage points" thinking. Find more effective interventions.

Then consider "partnership" to reduce the load on your business model.

Keep "experimental and flexible" as an ongoing mindset throughout.

And use "AI tools" at every stage to fill gaps in your knowledge.

Now let's look at how to
improve your impact model.

00:00:02,667 --> 00:00:04,727
Here are five strategic approaches.

3
00:00:05,321 --> 00:00:06,941
Firstly, copy from others.

4
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:09,800
If you're trying to address a
real problem, you don't have

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,330
to do it all from scratch.

6
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:14,699
Many organizations will have
already approached each piece

7
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:16,229
of your impact model before you.

8
00:00:16,563 --> 00:00:20,148
Perhaps in different communities
or geographies, look at how

9
00:00:20,148 --> 00:00:21,468
they're approaching the issue.

10
00:00:21,745 --> 00:00:24,235
There'll be many different
angles on how you can do this.

something, call 'em up and ask.

What approaches are they taking?

15
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:39,795
What seems to be working?

16
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:40,965
What hasn't worked?

17
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:42,473
Where have the struggles been?

18
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:47,471
What academic research, longitudinal
studies or evaluation reports

19
00:00:47,473 --> 00:00:49,063
prove aspects of your impact?

20
00:00:49,063 --> 00:00:49,423
Model logic.

21
00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:54,445
This research can put your impact model
on a solid footing and save you from

22
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:56,605
guessing wildly about what might work.

23
00:00:57,582 --> 00:01:01,469
Find leverage points in the system If
you can map the system that the issue

24
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,310
is occurring in, you can look for
leverage points in different parts of it.

25
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:09,595
You might find that intervening
earlier or in an adjacent part of the

the solution While you hold another piece,
collectively you might be more effective.

40

probably need to do it yourself.
