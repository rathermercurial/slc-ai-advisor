# no-legal-structure

## Definition
The `no-legal-structure` tag identifies ventures that have not yet decided on or established their legal structure, typically in very early stages of development.

## Usage Criteria
Apply this tag to ventures that:
- Have not yet incorporated or established legal structure
- Are in pre-legal formation stages
- Are exploring legal structure options
- Operate informally without formal legal entity
- Are in idea or very early development stages

## Always Include When
- Ventures in idea stage without legal formation
- Early-stage ventures exploring legal options
- Informal initiatives not yet legally structured
- Ventures seeking guidance on legal structure selection

## Never Include When
- Ventures with established legal structures
- Ventures that have made legal structure decisions
- Formal organizations with legal status

## Required Combinations
- Must include `venture-type` and `legal-structure`
- Often combined with `idea-stage` or `early-stage` venture tags
- May appear with `bootstrapped` funding (common before legal formation)

## Content Examples
- Early-stage venture case studies without legal formation
- Legal structure decision frameworks and guidance
- Pre-incorporation venture examples
- Idea-stage venture profiles

- Common in very early venture stages
- May limit funding and operational options
- Important for legal structure selection guidance
- Useful for tracking ventures through development stages

## Usage Notes
- This tag should be replaced with appropriate legal structure tag once venture formalizes
- Helpful for identifying ventures needing legal structure guidance
- Common in idea-stage and early-stage venture examples
- May be combined with legal structure decision-making content
