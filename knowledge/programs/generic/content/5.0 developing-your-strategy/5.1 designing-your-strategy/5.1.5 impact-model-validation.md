## Section 5.1.5: Validating Your Impact Model

**Tag line: "Prove your theory of change"**

### Why Impact Validation Matters

Now you have a plan for how you are going to validate your customer model. You need to do the same for your impact model.

`[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas - highlight Impact Model section]`

This matters deeply. There's a sad history of organizations who had the best intentions about the positive impact they planned to create, only to find out - sometimes much later - that they actually made the problem worse.

If important parts of your impact model don't work, you need to find out early so you can evolve your model into something that can work.

The stakes are high. You're working with people's lives, communities, and environments. Getting this right is not optional.

### Building on Your Module 4 Work

In Module 4, you worked through improving your impact model. You mapped your theory of change - the causal chain from activities through outcomes to impact. You tested the logic with experts and people with lived experience. You identified the riskiest assumptions.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Module 4 = theory of change | Module 5 = prove it works]`

Now you need to validate those assumptions. You're going to test whether your impact model actually creates the change you predict.

### What to Validate: Walking the Causal Chain

You need to validate assumptions across all the components of your impact model.

`[MAIN PANEL: Impact Model section with components highlighted]`

**Issue** - Are you addressing the right problem? Is this the root cause or just a symptom?

**Participants** - Will they engage in your activities as predicted? Do they have the capacity and motivation you assume?

**Activities** - Can you actually deliver these activities as planned? Do you have the capability and resources?

**Short-term Outcomes** - Do your activities create the immediate changes you predict? This is what you can measure quickly.

**Medium-term Outcomes** - Do the short-term outcomes build into the one to two year effects you predict? This takes longer to validate.

**Long-term Outcomes** - Do the medium-term outcomes create the sustained changes over two to ten years that you predict?

**Impact** - Does the ultimate state of change align with your Purpose?

`[VISUAL TEXT: Issue → Participants → Activities → Outcomes → Impact]`

### Toast Ale: Impact Model Assumptions

For our hypothetical Toast Ale founders, here's what they need to validate:

**Issue** - Is food waste actually a significant environmental problem? Are emissions from food waste as harmful as they believe?

**Participants** - Will bakeries partner with them to provide surplus bread? Will they do this reliably?

**Activities** - Can they collect bread efficiently? Can they brew beer at scale using surplus bread? Can they fund environmental charities with profits?

**Short-term Outcomes** - Does each batch of beer actually divert bread from landfill? Do they avoid the emissions that would have resulted?

**Medium/Long-term Outcomes** - Does scaling their beer production create measurable reduction in food waste? Do the charities they fund create environmental outcomes?

**Impact** - Does this contribute meaningfully to reducing environmental harm and fighting climate change?

`[MAIN PANEL: Toast Ale impact model with assumption areas highlighted]`

Some of these can be validated quickly. Others will take years.

### Three Validation Approaches

Depending on how your impact model works, your validation approach may vary greatly.

It could be that your impact model is in a well-understood space and you're delivering a predictable intervention that produces predictable outcomes.

But you also might have an impact model that's trying to address a deep systemic social issue which requires discovery and sensemaking work in partnership with people who have lived experience of the issues you're addressing, and exploration across multiple interconnected and complex systems.

Depending on your particular impact model and how well validated it already is, there are three main approaches to validation that you can combine as part of your validation plan.

### Research: Leveraging Existing Knowledge

The first approach is research. Many aspects of your impact model may already be well understood. You can leverage existing studies and evidence rather than having to prove everything yourself.

`[VISUAL TEXT: research validates = causal logic | future outcomes | general space]`

Research can validate several things:

**The general space your impact model sits in** - How does the impact world think about the issue you're addressing? What are the different approaches to this issue that are already well understood? What has worked? What hasn't?

**Causal links in your theory of change** - Academic research, longitudinal studies, or evaluation reports might prove the connections between your short, medium, and long-term outcomes. You don't need to amass your own primary research on this.

**Future outcomes that would take too long to measure directly** - You might validate that a short-term outcome will result from an activity by running your own experiment. But you can rely on research into other organizations' experiences or academic studies to validate that the short-term outcome will drive the medium and long-term outcomes. This lets you have confidence in your full causal chain without waiting years to measure it yourself.

For Toast Ale, the environmental impacts of food waste are well researched. There are studies on emissions from food waste in landfills. Research on the carbon footprint of brewing. Data on how much bread waste is generated.

This research validates major parts of their impact logic without them having to prove it themselves.

### Experiments: Testing Your Specific Model

The second approach is experiments. Even when research validates general principles, you need to prove your specific approach works in your specific context.

`[MAIN PANEL: Experiment design framework]`

**Qualitative discovery** - If there are many unknowns about participants in your impact model and how they're going to respond to what you're trying to do, start with qualitative exploration. Talk to participants. Understand their context. Co-create solutions with them.

**Quantitative validation** - Once you understand the dynamics qualitatively, run pilots to measure whether activities create the outcomes you predict. Start small. Measure carefully. Scale when you have evidence it works.

For Toast Ale, they need experiments to validate their specific model:

**Qualitative** - Conversations with bakeries to understand their surplus bread situation. How much do they have? When? What would make partnership easy or difficult? Do they see value in this relationship?

**Quantitative** - A pilot with three bakeries collecting bread for three months. They measure: How much bread is actually diverted? How reliable is the collection process? What are the actual emissions avoided? Does the bread-to-beer conversion work at this scale?

They're not validating whether food waste is a problem - research already proved that. They're validating whether their specific activities can create the outcomes they predict.

`[VISUAL TEXT: qualitative = understand dynamics | quantitative = measure outcomes]`

### Leveraging Other People's Models: Strategic Partnership

The third approach is leveraging already validated impact models through strategic partnership.

Rather than developing and testing your own impact model from scratch, you could use resources you planned to allocate to impact delivery to fund another organization who already has a validated impact model and delivery mechanism.

This can be a powerful strategy, especially for organizations with complex social impact models that have lots of unknowns. It lets you side-step much of the complexity and cost of developing and testing your own impact model. You can focus on developing the other aspects of your business model while still creating impact.

Assuming the partner organization has a well-developed and successful impact model, you're inheriting their validation work. You're not starting from zero.

`[VISUAL TEXT: strategic partnership = inherit validated model | focus elsewhere]`

For Toast Ale, they use this approach for part of their impact model. Rather than trying to create environmental outcomes directly, they donate profits to fund environmental charities.

These charities have validated impact models for fighting climate change, protecting ecosystems, or addressing environmental issues. Toast Ale doesn't need to validate those impact pathways - they leverage the charities' proven work.

This lets Toast Ale focus their validation efforts on the food waste diversion part of their model, which is unique to them and needs their own proof.

### Choosing Your Validation Approach

For each assumption in your impact model, decide which approach makes sense:

Can existing research validate this? Use research.

Do you need to prove your specific approach works? Run experiments.

Could strategic partnership let you leverage someone else's validated model? Explore partnership.

Often you'll use all three approaches for different parts of your impact model. That's smart - use the right tool for each assumption.

`[VISUAL TEXT: research | experiments | partnership | use what fits]`

### Designing Your Validation Plan

Now take your risky assumptions from Module 4 and assign validation approaches to each.

For research: What studies exist? What do other organizations' experiences show? What can you learn from the field?

For experiments: What pilots can you run? What will you measure? How will you know if your activities are creating predicted outcomes?

For partnerships: Who has validated impact models you could leverage? What would partnership look like?

Remember that impact validation often takes longer than customer validation. Short-term outcomes might be measurable in months. Long-term outcomes might take years. Use research to validate future outcomes rather than waiting to measure them yourself.



**Create your validation plan document.** List your experiments in priority order, starting with the riskiest assumptions. For each experiment, document:
- What assumption(s) it tests
- How you'll run it (method, participants, scale)
- Success criteria (what proves it right or wrong)
- Timeline and resources needed

This plan becomes your input for building your strategy model

Now lets look at economic model validation

1
00:00:00,015 --> 00:00:03,002
Now you have a Plan  You're gonna
validate your customer model.

2
00:00:03,122 --> 00:00:05,072
You need to do the same
for your impact model.

3
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:06,653
This matters deeply.

4
00:00:06,996 --> 00:00:11,269
There's a sad history of organizations
who had the best intentions about the

5
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:15,955
positive impact that they plan to create,
only to find out sometimes much later

6
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,062
that they actually made the problem worse.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,240
If important parts of your impact
model don't work, you need to find

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,990
out early so that you can evolve the
model into something that can work.

9
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:30,017
The stakes are high if you're
working with people's lives,

10
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:31,847
communities, and environments.

11
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:33,721
Getting it right is not optional.

12
00:00:34,678 --> 00:00:38,350
In the previous module, you worked
through improving your impact model.

13
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:41,551
You mapped your theory of
change, the causal change from

14
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:43,081
activities through outcomes to.

15
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:48,224
You tested the logic with experts
and people with lived experience.

16
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:51,686
you identified the riskiest
assumptions in your impact model.

17
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:54,702
Now you need to validate
those assumptions.

18
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:57,536
You're gonna test whether
your impact model actually

19
00:00:57,536 --> 00:00:59,096
creates the change you predict.

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,060
You need to validate assumptions across
all of the components of your impact.

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,698
Model  The issue.

22
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:06,511
Are you addressing the right problem?

23
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:08,918
Is this the root cause or just a symptom?

24
00:01:09,452 --> 00:01:12,658
Participants, will they engage
in your activities as predicted?

25
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:15,663
Do they have the capacity
and motivation you assume?

26
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:17,095
activities.

27
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:19,905
Can you actually deliver
these activities as planned?

28
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:22,442
Do you have the capability
and the resources?

29
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:23,974
Short term outcomes?

30
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:27,154
Do your activities create the
immediate changes you predict?

31
00:01:27,442 --> 00:01:29,392
this is something that
you can measure quickly.

32
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:32,749
Do the short term outcomes
build into the one and two

33
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:34,249
year outcomes that you predict.

34
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:37,736
This takes longer to
validate  Long term outcomes.

35
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,857
Do your medium term outcomes create
sustained changes over two to 10

36
00:01:41,857 --> 00:01:44,296
years  and finally, the impact.

37
00:01:44,497 --> 00:01:46,957
Does the ultimate state
of change align with your.

38
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:52,501
For our hypothetical to stale founders,
here's what they needed to validate.

39
00:01:52,837 --> 00:01:54,491
Issue is food waste.

40
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:57,131
Actually a significant
environmental problem.

41
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:00,034
Our emissions from food waste
as harmful as they believe.

42
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:00,414
Okay.

43
00:02:00,632 --> 00:02:04,348
Participants will bakeries partner
with them to provide surplus bread.

44
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:05,843
Will they do this reliably?

45
00:02:06,074 --> 00:02:06,884
Activities?

46
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:08,706
Can they collect bread efficiently?

47
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:11,606
Can they brew beer at
scale using surplus bread?

48
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:14,597
Can they fund environmental
charities with the profits?

49
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:16,006
Short term outcomes?

50
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:19,184
Does each batch of beer actually
divert bread from landfill?

51
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:24,029
Do they avoid the emissions that would've
resulted medium and long-term outcomes?

52
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,379
Does scaling their beer a production
create measurable reduction in food waste?

53
00:02:28,558 --> 00:02:31,462
and do the charities that they
funded create environmental

54
00:02:31,462 --> 00:02:33,461
outcomes and finally, impact.

55
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:37,437
Does this contribute meaningfully
to reducing environmental harm

56
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:38,847
and fighting climate change?

57
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:41,563
Some of these can be validated quickly.

58
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:44,887
Others will take years to validate,
and so they'll have to rely

59
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:46,327
on research in the short term.

60
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:51,462
Depending on how your impact model works,
your validation approach may vary greatly.

61
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:55,891
It could be that your impact model is
in a well understood space and you're

62
00:02:55,891 --> 00:03:00,181
dealing with a predictable intervention
that produces predictable outcomes.

63
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:04,546
But you also might have an impact model
that's trying to address a deep, systemic

64
00:03:04,546 --> 00:03:09,157
social issue, which requires discovery
and sense making work in partnership

65
00:03:09,157 --> 00:03:12,307
with people who have lived experience
of the issues you're addressing.

66
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:16,744
and exploration across multiple
interconnected and complex systems.

67
00:03:17,272 --> 00:03:21,633
Depending on your particular impact model
and how well validated it already is.

68
00:03:21,653 --> 00:03:24,321
There are three main approaches
to validation that you can

69
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:26,196
combine in your validation plan.

70
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:28,621
The first approach is research.

71
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:32,326
Many aspects of your impact model
may already be well understood.

72
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,970
You can leverage existing studies
and evidence rather than having

73
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,410
to prove everything yourself.

74
00:03:37,656 --> 00:03:39,692
Research can validate several things.

75
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:41,861
The general space, your
impact model sits in.

76
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:44,893
How does the impact world think
about the issue you're addressing?

77
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:48,780
What are the different approaches to this
issue that are already well understood.

78
00:03:49,065 --> 00:03:50,684
What has worked,  what hasn't?

79
00:03:51,175 --> 00:03:54,808
Causal links in your theory of change,
Academic research, longitudinal

80
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:58,623
studies or evaluation reports  might
prove the connections between your

81
00:03:58,623 --> 00:04:00,813
short, medium, and long term outcomes.

82
00:04:00,923 --> 00:04:05,705
You don't need to amass your own primary
research on this future outcomes that

83
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:07,565
would take too long to measure directly.

84
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:11,306
You might validate that a short term
outcome will result from the activity

85
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:14,909
by running your own experiment, but
you can rely on research from other

86
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:19,589
organizations or academic studies to
validate that the short-term outcomes will

87
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,109
drive the medium and long-term outcomes.

88
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:25,560
this lets you have confidence in
your full causal chain without

89
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,390
waiting years to measure it yourself.

90
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:31,867
For toast ale, the environmental impacts
of food waste are well researched.

91
00:04:32,162 --> 00:04:36,112
There are studies on emissions from
food waste and landfills, research

92
00:04:36,112 --> 00:04:37,942
on the carbon footprint of brewing.

93
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,499
Data on how much bread waste is generated.

94
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:44,359
This research validates major parts
of their impact logic without them

95
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,829
having to prove it themselves.

96
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:48,573
The second approach is experiments.

97
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:52,215
Even when research validates
general principles, you need

98
00:04:52,215 --> 00:04:56,025
to prove your specific approach
works and your specific context.

99
00:04:56,615 --> 00:05:00,618
Qualitative discovery, If there are
many unknowns about participants in your

100
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:03,874
impact model  and how they're going to
respond to what you're trying to do.

101
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:06,025
Start with qualitative exploration.

102
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:10,634
Talk to participants, understand their
contexts, co-create solutions with them.

103
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:12,489
Quantitative validation.

104
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,369
Once you understand the
dynamics qualitatively.

105
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:19,497
Run pilots to measure whether activities
create the outcomes you predict.

106
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:23,021
Start small, measure carefully
scale when you have evidence

107
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:24,915
that it works for toe stale.

108
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:27,705
They needed experiments to
validate their specific model.

109
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:32,412
qualitative conversations with bakeries to
understand their surplus breed situation.

110
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:34,400
How much do they have when?

111
00:05:34,663 --> 00:05:36,638
What would make partnership
easy or difficult?

112
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:38,948
Do they see value in this relationship?

113
00:05:39,317 --> 00:05:40,293
and quantitative.

114
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:43,681
A pilot with three bakeries
collecting bread for three months.

115
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:47,081
They measure how much bread is
actually diverted, how reliable

116
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,491
the collection process is.

117
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,453
What are the actual emissions avoided?

118
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:53,496
and does the bread to beer
conversion work at the scale?

119
00:05:54,116 --> 00:05:56,596
They're not validating whether
food waste is a problem.

120
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:59,537
Research already proved that
they're validating whether their

121
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:02,807
specific activities can create
the outcomes they predict.

122
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:07,105
The third approach is leveraging
already validated impact models

123
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:08,725
through strategic partnerships.

124
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:13,088
Rather than developing and testing your
own impact model from scratch,  You

125
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:17,219
could use resources you plan to allocate,
to impact delivery,  to fund another

126
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:21,539
organization who already has a validated
impact model and delivery mechanism.

127
00:06:21,975 --> 00:06:25,873
This can be a powerful strategy,
Especially for organizations with complex

128
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:30,801
social impact models that have lots of
unknowns, it lets you sidestep much of

129
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:34,414
the complexity and cost of developing
and testing your own impact model.

130
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:37,662
you can focus on developing the
other aspects of your business

131
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:39,522
model while still creating impact.

132
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,921
Assuming the partner organization
has a well developed and

133
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:44,061
successful impact model.

134
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:46,603
You're inheriting their validation work.

135
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:49,498
You're not starting
from zero for toe stale.

136
00:06:49,602 --> 00:06:52,787
They use this approach for part of
their impact model Rather than trying

137
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,853
to create environmental outcomes
directly beyond food waste reuse.

138
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:59,969
They donate their profits
to environmental charities.

139
00:07:00,207 --> 00:07:03,632
These charities have validated impact
models for fighting climate change,

140
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:07,883
protecting ecosystems or addressing
environmental issues to ALE doesn't

141
00:07:07,883 --> 00:07:09,893
need to validate those impact pathways.

142
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:12,323
They leverage the charity's proven work.

143
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:17,505
This lets tote focus their validation
efforts on the food waste diversion

144
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:21,204
part of their model, which is unique
to them and needs their own proof.

145
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:26,159
For each assumption in your impact
model, decide which approach makes sense.

146
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,649
Can existing research validate this?

147
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,739
Use research?

148
00:07:30,046 --> 00:07:32,626
Do you need to prove your
specific approach works?

149
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:33,707
Run experiments?

150
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:38,011
Could strategic partnership let you
leverage someone else's validated model?

151
00:07:38,107 --> 00:07:39,217
Explore partnerships.

152
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:43,575
Often you'll use all three approaches
for different parts of your impact model.

153
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:44,535
That's smart.

154
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:46,508
Use the right tool for each assumption.

155
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:51,731
Now, take your risky assumptions from
the previous module and assign validation

156
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:53,921
approaches to each for research.

157
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:55,241
What studies exist?

158
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:57,999
What do other organizations
experiences show?

159
00:07:58,134 --> 00:08:01,022
What can you learn from
the field for experiments?

160
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:02,542
What pilots can you run?

161
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:03,795
What will you measure?

162
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,943
How will you know if your activities
are creating the predicted

163
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:11,390
outcomes  For partnerships, who has
validated impact models and delivery

164
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,100
mechanisms that you could leverage?

165
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,480
What would partnership look like?

166
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:19,624
Remember that impact validation often
takes longer than customer validation.

167
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,504
Short-term outcomes might
be measurable in months.

168
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:24,639
Long-term outcomes might take years.

169
00:08:24,686 --> 00:08:27,898
Use research to validate future
outcomes rather than waiting

170
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:29,038
to measure them yourself.

171
00:08:30,017 --> 00:08:31,959
Create your validation plan document.

172
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,226
List your experiments in priority order,
starting with the riskiest assumptions.

173
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:40,815
For each experiment document, what
assumptions it tests, how you'll run it.

174
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:46,214
The method participants scale success
criteria, what proves it right or wrong,

175
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:48,365
and timeline and resources needed.

176
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:52,717
This plan becomes your input for
building your strategy model.

177
00:08:53,474 --> 00:08:56,054
Now let's look at
economic model validation.
