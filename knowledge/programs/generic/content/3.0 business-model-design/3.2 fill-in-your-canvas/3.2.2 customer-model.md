# Script

## Purpose 

### Overview

1. Your customer model outlines how you create value for your customers
    
2. Creating value for customers that you can get paid for is what drives your business model
    
3. Your customer model pulls together 4 key sections of you canvas
    

4. Your customers
    
5. The jobs they need done
    
6. The unique value proposition that they will respond to
    
7. And the solution you will give them that they (or another of your customers) will pay for
    

8. Your customer model could be very simple with a single group of customers who pay for a single simple product. Or it can be much more complex. And Social enterprises often tend to be more complex here than traditional ones
    
9. Developing this customer model is about understanding how these 4 canvas sections come together to form a coherent model of how you will create value for your customers
    

### Customers

CustomerModel.Customers.1

Your customers are those people or organisations that you need to move to make your business model work

1. You need to categorise them in 2 ways -  firstly your customer types and secondly your customer segments
    
2. Customer types  are the different categories of customer who play completely different roles in your business mode.
    
3. Some businesses only have one customer type, for example "the consumer who buys and consumes your product"
    
4. But in more complex business models, especially in social enterprise, there can be several customer types - for example
    

5. Users
    
6. Funders
    
7. Advertisers
    
8. Sponsors
    
9. Government buyers - all can be different customer types
    
10. With multiple customer types it is the combination of the different customer types that collectively creates the value needed for your business model to work
    

11. If you have more than one customer type try to colour code or number them in your canvas because each customer type will have a correspondingly different job to be done and a different unique value proposition
    

### Customer segments

CustomerModel.Customers.2

1. For your customer segments, these are the sub groups of customers that sit inside each of your customer types - for the canvas sketch the core customer segment that you are going to serve for each of your customer types
    

2. For example - if you have a customer type - users - your main User customer segment might be "stay home parents"
    

3. Keep your customers section simple. Include only those types and segments that you NEED to make you business model work.
    
4. Depending on your business model, your participants from your impact model might also be classified as customers (if they are people that you have to move to make your business model work) but if you don't rely on them for your business model to succeed then don't include them in your customers section.
    
5. Any extra customers you include in here that you don't actually need, will just add unnecessary complexity to your business model
    

##### Early adopters

CustomerModel.Customers.EarlyAdopters

1. Your early adopters are a small sub group of your customer segments who you think will have the strongest desire for your solution. For example - for our Customer type  Users and our customer segment of "stay home parents" our early adopters might be "stay home parents who have just had their first child"
    
2. These will be the customers who you will engage with first to learn from and test out your ideas
    
3. Only include early adopters for customer types that will be in significant numbers. If the customer type is, for example a single government funder then there is no need to identify early adopters here, because they are the single customer, they don't represent a larger market that you are planning to sell to.
    

### Jobs to be done

CustomerModel.Jobs

Filling in the Jobs to be done section of the canvas is about understanding what is motivating your customers. What will drive them to engage with your solution? What Job is your customer going to hire your product or service to do for them?

1. Make sure you go deeper here than just the obvious need the customer has, dig deep to find the particular thing that YOU will do for them that isn't currently available to them somewhere else
    
2. Identify at least one key Job to be done for each of your customer types
    
3. Colour code or number each job to be done, so you can see what customer type they relate to 
    

Clearly identifying and understanding the Job that your customer needs done is really important, it's the basis for how your business model will create value for them.

  

#### Existing alternatives

CustomerModel.Jobs.ExistingAlternatives

Existing alternatives show how your future customers are currently getting these jobs done and this is important for 2 main reasons

1. Firstly it shows evidence of customer need - if your potential customers are already engaging with an existing alternative,  it shows that the customer actually does wants this job to be done in real life.
    
2. Secondly is starts to outline who your competitors might be showing you who is already out there doing these jobs for your customers.
    
3. You might also find that you are competing against an existing alternative of "just doing nothing" . This is important to identify early, because if your future customers are not currently trying to get these jobs done, then it could mean that they don't really care about getting them done after all.
    

### UVP

CustomerModel.UVP

Your unique value proposition describes the benefits that your customers are going to get from using your product or service. A UVP is based on the particular Job that your customer is trying to get done and the special way that you are going to do this job for them.

1. This is not the same thing as the solution section of the canvas, where you describe your product or service. This is about describing the benefit that the customer will get from using your product or service
    
2. If you have more than one customer type you will have a different Job to be done for each different customer type, and likewise you will have different Unique Value Propositions for each as well. Number or colour code these the same way you did for the jobs to be done section
    

The unique value proposition section is where you demonstrate that you have deeply understood your customers. You have understood what they are trying to achieve, what value they are trying to get and how to talk to them about it.

  

### Solution

CustomerModel.Solution

The last section to fill in in your customer model is the solution section. This part of you canvas is where you describe what your enterprise actually does. Your product or service.

1. Your solution is what's going to deliver the value to your customers in a way that at least some of them will pay for
    
2. As well as this, your solution also needs to deliver the social or environmental impact that is mapped out in your impact model. So make sure you describe the parts of your solution that deliver the activities in your impact model
    
3. Keep the description of your solution simple and high level. You don't need to go into great detail, but make sure that you cover off the key aspects of it, so that it clearly shows how it's going to create both customer value and impact
    

  

## Example of customer model - Facebook

CustomerModel.Example.FB.Intro

Add in example videos and diagrams

  

As a way of demonstrating how the customer model works, let's walk through an example using the early days of Facebook and their customer model. Now Facebook isn't an impact driven organisation but the'll be useful here.

They are a company you should already be familiar with, as well as being an example that has more than one customer type. 

1. For this example we are going to talk about the simple version Facebook from when they first started out. Not the behemoth that they are today.
    
2. When they started their vision was simple, become the largest social network on global university campuses.
    

### Customers

1. So lets get into it, starting with the customers section of their canvas - At the start, Facebook had 2 different customer types in mind
    
2. Firstly - Users - people who will use the social network
    
3. and secondly - Advertisers - Organisations who will pay to have their ads viewed by Facebook's users - so those are the two distinct types of customers who are getting 2 completely different types of value out of facebook
    
4. Next - for their customer segments - we zero in on the markets within each customer type that Facebook will actually try to serve
    
5. For Users - they zeroed in on university students as their main user customer segment. Of course as they grew and succeeded they broadened this out to include many many more segments. But to start with they were tightly focused on students
    
6. Their early adopters in this student customer segment  were (and i'm guessing here) something like "dorm room students who are living away from home for the first time". They would likely have more of an immediate social need to be filled than other students
    
7. For the Advertiser customer type - they would zero in on the kinds of advertisers who are often targeting students and would value Facebook's unique value proposition to do this more effectively. This might include the fashion or music industry advertisers or other entertainment industry advertisers
    
8. For early adopters in this Advertiser customer segment - they would again zero in and find a smaller advertising segment that is currently working hard reach students that they can start with - this might be "local event promoters"  
      
    

###  Jobs to be done  
    CustomerModel.Example.FB.Jobs  
      
    

13. Now moving on to the Jobs to be done section of their Canvas
    
14. For the student User customer type - the job they are trying to get done might be something like "Meeting people and making new friends"
    

15. The Existing alternatives to do this job might include joining clubs and sports groups or going to bars and attending parties
    

16. For the Adver tiser type - The Job to be done could be "finding more effective methods of reaching our target audiences"
    

17. The Existing alternatives for this might be "un-targeted online banner advertising or traditional print advertising etc"  
      
    

### Unique Value Proposition  
    CustomerModel.Example.FB.UVP  
      
    

19. Now the Unique value proposition
    
20. For students the Unique Value Proposition might be something like "easily meet and connect with new friends in a low social risk way"
    
21. For advertisers it could be "Highly targeted advertising that guarantees you better engagement and higher click through rates"
    
22. You can see here that the Unique value propositions map directly to the jobs to be done that each different customer type has. This is how you translate the need that the customer has, into clearly articulated value that you can provide for them.
    

### Solution  
    CustomerModel.Example.FB.Solution  
      
    

24. And for their solution section,
    
25. Their solution description needs to tie together both of their customer types (and also if Facebook was an impact driven enterprise, it would need to describe their impact activities as well)
    
26. Facebook's early solution description would be something like - "An online social media application that creates a student social network, that also provides a highly targeted advertising platform."  
      
    

### Conclusion  
    CustomerModel.Example.FB.Conclusion  
      
    

28. You can see using this simple example of Facebook, that all of these sections of the canvas need to fit together in a coherent way, to form the customer model. They need to clearly outline how the customer model creates value for customers, in a way that Facebook can earn its revenue.
    
29. The value it creates for its Users by getting an important job done for them, in turn creates the ability for Facebook to sell a different kind of value to its advertisers. All of these pieces need to work together to create a powerful customer model that can succeed.
    


**CustomerModel.Overview**
1
00:00:00,059 --> 00:00:04,229
Your customer model outlines how
you create value for your customers.

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:07,439
Creating value for customers
that you can get paid for is

3
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:09,089
what drives your business model.

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,249
Your customer model pulls together
four key sections of the canvas, your

5
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:18,989
customers, the jobs they need done,
the unique value proposition that

6
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:24,119
they will respond to, and the solution
that you will give them that they and

7
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,129
other of your customers will pay for.

8
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:31,634
Your customer model could be very simple
with a single group of customers who pay

9
00:00:31,634 --> 00:00:37,304
for a single simple product, or it can be
much more complex, and social enterprises

10
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:41,984
often tend to be more complex than
traditional ones in the customer model.

11
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:47,594
Developing this customer model is
about understanding how these four

12
00:00:47,594 --> 00:00:52,214
canvas sections come together to
form a coherent model of how you'll

13
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:53,924
create value for your customers.



**CustomerModel.Customers.1**
1
00:00:00,168 --> 00:00:04,638
Your customers are those people or
organizations that you need to move

2
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,468
to make your business model work.

3
00:00:07,038 --> 00:00:09,438
You need to categorize them in two ways.

4
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:14,478
Firstly, your customer types, and
secondly, your customer segments.

5
00:00:15,018 --> 00:00:18,738
Customer types are the different
categories of customers who

6
00:00:18,738 --> 00:00:21,828
play completely different
roles in your business model.

7
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:26,388
Some businesses only have one customer
type, for example, the customer

8
00:00:26,388 --> 00:00:28,278
who buys and consumes your product.

9
00:00:29,268 --> 00:00:33,618
But in more complex business models,
especially in social enterprise, there

10
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:35,508
can be several types of customers.

11
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:42,323
For example, users, funders, advertisers,
sponsors, government buyers, or

12
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:44,028
can be different customer types.

13
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:46,553
With multiple customer types.

14
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:50,543
It's the, this combination of the
different customer types working

15
00:00:50,543 --> 00:00:54,683
collectively that creates the value
needed for your business model to work.

16
00:00:55,703 --> 00:01:00,203
If you have more than one customer
type, try to color code or number them

17
00:01:00,473 --> 00:01:04,883
in your canvas because each customer
type will have a correspondingly

18
00:01:04,883 --> 00:01:08,933
different job to be done and
different unique value proposition

19
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:10,433
that you'll have to create for them.



**CustomerModel.Customers.2**
1
00:00:00,141 --> 00:00:01,821
For your customer segments.

2
00:00:02,226 --> 00:00:06,036
These are the subgroups of customers
that sit inside each of your

3
00:00:06,036 --> 00:00:08,706
customer types For the canvas.

4
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:12,366
Sketch out the core customer
segment that you're gonna serve

5
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:14,316
for each of your customer types.

6
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:20,646
For example, if you have a customer
type of user, your main user customer

7
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,286
segment might be stay home parents.

8
00:00:23,976 --> 00:00:29,676
Keep your customer section simple, only
include those types and segments that you

9
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:31,746
need to make your business model work.

10
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:36,336
Depending on your business model, your
participants from your impact model

11
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:38,796
might also be classified as customers.

12
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:43,121
If they are people that you have to
move to make your business model work,

13
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:47,741
but if you don't rely on them for your
business model to succeed, then don't

14
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:49,661
include them in your customers section.

15
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:55,511
Any extra customers you include
in here that you don't actually

16
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:59,741
need will just add unnecessary
complexity to your business model.



**CustomerModel.Customers.EarlyAdopters**

1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,620
Your early adopters are the small
subgroup of your customer segments

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,775
who you think will have the
strongest desire for your solution.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,620
For example, for our customer
type of user and our customer

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,540
segment of stay home parents.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,200
Our early adopters might be
stay home parents who have

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,730
just had their first child.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,840
These will be the customers
who you'll engage with first

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,820
to learn from and test out.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,650
Your ideas only include early
adopters for customer types, that

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,300
will be in significant numbers.

11
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:38,745
If the customer type is, for example, a
single government funder, then there's

12
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:43,305
no need to identify early adopters
here because they're a single customer.

13
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:47,415
They don't res represent a larger market
that you're planning on selling to.



**CustomerModel.Jobs**
1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:01,749
Filling in the jobs to be done.

2
00:00:01,749 --> 00:00:04,779
Section of the canvas is
about understanding what's

3
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:06,399
motivating your customers.

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:09,669
What will drive them to
engage with your solution?

5
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:14,919
What job is your customer going to hire
your product or service to do for them?

6
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:19,014
Make sure that you go deeper
here than just the obvious

7
00:00:19,014 --> 00:00:20,454
need that the customer has.

8
00:00:21,084 --> 00:00:24,414
Dig deep to find the particular
thing that you will be able to

9
00:00:24,414 --> 00:00:28,914
do for them that isn't currently
available to them from someone else.

10
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:33,114
Identify at least one key job to
be done for each of your customer

11
00:00:33,114 --> 00:00:37,764
types, and then color code or number
each of them so that you can see

12
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:39,864
what customer type they relate to.

13
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:44,599
Clearly identifying and understanding
the jobs that your customers

14
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:47,179
need done is really important.

15
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:51,499
It's the basis for how your business
model will create value for them.


**CustomerModel.Jobs.ExistingAlternatives**

1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:03,589
Existing alternatives show
how your future customers are

2
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:05,209
currently getting these jobs done.

3
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:07,759
And this is important
for two main reasons.

4
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:11,059
Firstly, it shows
evidence of customer need.

5
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:15,919
If your potential customers are already
engaging with an existing alternative,

6
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:20,629
it shows that the customer actually does
want this job to be done in real life.

7
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:25,834
Secondly, it starts to outline who
your competitors might be showing

8
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:28,864
you who is already out there doing
these jobs for your customer.

9
00:00:30,034 --> 00:00:33,004
You might also find that you're
competing against an existing

10
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:35,194
alternative of just doing nothing.

11
00:00:35,974 --> 00:00:40,324
This is important to identify early
because if your future customers are not

12
00:00:40,324 --> 00:00:44,914
currently trying to get these jobs done,
then it could mean that they don't really

13
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:47,104
care about getting them done after all.


**CustomerModel.UVP**

1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:04,189
Your unique value proposition describes
the benefits that your customers are gonna

2
00:00:04,189 --> 00:00:06,559
get from using your product or service.

3
00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:11,209
A UVP is based on the particular
job that your customer is trying to

4
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:15,204
get done and the special way that
you are gonna do this job for them.

5
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:20,404
This is not the same thing as the
solution section of the canvas where

6
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:22,534
you describe your product or service.

7
00:00:22,894 --> 00:00:26,284
This is about describing the benefit
that your customer will get from

8
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:28,264
using your product or service.

9
00:00:28,894 --> 00:00:32,704
If you have more than one customer
type, you will have a different job

10
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:37,384
to be done for each customer type, and
likewise, you'll have a different unique

11
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:39,274
value proposition for each as well.

12
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:43,684
Number or color code these in
the same way that you did in

13
00:00:43,684 --> 00:00:45,124
the Jobs to be Done section.

14
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,789
The unique value proposition section
is where you demonstrate that you have

15
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:53,959
deeply understood your customers, you
have understood what they're trying to

16
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:58,429
achieve, what value they're trying to
get, and how to talk to them about it.



**CustomerModel.Solution**
1
00:00:00,113 --> 00:00:03,983
The last section to fill in in your
customer model is the solution section.

2
00:00:04,313 --> 00:00:07,373
This is the part of the canvas where
you describe what your enterprise

3
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:10,163
actually does, your product or service.

4
00:00:10,943 --> 00:00:15,173
Your solution is what's gonna deliver
the value to your customers in a way

5
00:00:15,173 --> 00:00:16,853
that at least some of them will pay for.

6
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:22,508
As well as this, your solution needs to
deliver the social or environmental impact

7
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:24,488
that's mapped out in your impact model.

8
00:00:24,938 --> 00:00:28,448
So make sure that you describe the
parts of your solution that will deliver

9
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:31,118
the activities in your impact model.

10
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,528
Keep the description of your
solution simple and high level.

11
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:39,338
You don't need to go into great
detail, but make sure that you cover

12
00:00:39,338 --> 00:00:43,898
off the key aspects of it so that it
clearly shows both how you're gonna

13
00:00:43,898 --> 00:00:46,448
create customer value and impact.




**CustomerModel.Example.FB.Intro**
1
00:00:00,103 --> 00:00:03,433
as a way of demonstrating
how the customer model works.

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:06,793
Let's walk through an example
using the early days of Facebook

3
00:00:06,793 --> 00:00:07,933
and their customer model.

4
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:12,043
Now, Facebook isn't an impact
driven organization, but

5
00:00:12,043 --> 00:00:13,243
they'll still be useful here.

6
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:16,843
They're a company you should
already be familiar with, as well

7
00:00:16,843 --> 00:00:20,143
as being an example of one that
has more than one customer type.

8
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,598
For this example, we're gonna talk
through the simple version of Facebook

9
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:29,368
from when they first started out, not
the behemoth that they are today when

10
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:31,228
they started, their vision was simple.

11
00:00:31,318 --> 00:00:35,008
Become the largest social
network on university campuses.



**CustomerModel.Example.FB.Customers**
1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:01,099
So let's get into it.

2
00:00:01,099 --> 00:00:03,889
Starting with the customer
section of their canvas.

3
00:00:04,369 --> 00:00:08,059
At the start, Facebook had two
different customer types in mind.

4
00:00:08,329 --> 00:00:13,039
Firstly, users, people who will use
the social network, and secondly,

5
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:17,719
advertisers, organizations who pay to
have their ads viewed by Facebook's users.

6
00:00:18,889 --> 00:00:23,329
So those are the two distinct types of
customers who are gonna get completely

7
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:25,909
different types of value out of Facebook.

8
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,254
Next for their customer segments.

9
00:00:29,284 --> 00:00:33,634
We zero in on the markets within
each customer type that Facebook will

10
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:36,544
actually try and serve for users.

11
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:40,864
They zeroed in on university students
as their main user, customer segment.

12
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:44,014
Of course, as they grew and succeeded.

13
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:47,674
They broadened this out to include
many more customer segments.

14
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,824
But to start with, they were
tightly focused on students.

15
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:55,894
The early adopters in the student customer
segment were, and I'm guessing here

16
00:00:56,314 --> 00:01:00,994
something like dorm room students who are
living away from home for the first time.

17
00:01:01,744 --> 00:01:05,374
These students would likely have more
of an immediate social need to be

18
00:01:05,374 --> 00:01:07,804
fulfilled, um, ahead of other students.

19
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:14,134
For the advertiser customer type, they
would zero in on the kinds of advertisers

20
00:01:14,134 --> 00:01:18,634
who were often targeting students and
would value Facebook's unique value

21
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:20,644
proposition to do this more effectively.

22
00:01:21,394 --> 00:01:26,284
This might include fashion or music
industry advertisers, or other

23
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:27,994
entertainment industry advertisers.

24
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:34,444
For early adopters in this advertiser
customer segment, again, they would zero

25
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:39,034
in to find smaller advertising segments
that are currently working hard to

26
00:01:39,034 --> 00:01:41,014
reach students that they can start with.

27
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:46,804
This might be local event promoters who
are working hard to reach students in

28
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:51,214
a local environment and make them good
candidates to actually test ideas on.



**CustomerModel.Example.FB.Jobs**
1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:04,947
Now moving on to the jobs to be done
section of their canvas For the student

2
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:10,017
user, customer type, the job they're
trying to get done might be something like

3
00:00:10,017 --> 00:00:12,237
meeting people and making new friends.

4
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:18,237
The existing alternatives to do this
job might include joining clubs and

5
00:00:18,237 --> 00:00:23,727
sports groups, or going to bars and
attending parties for the advertiser type.

6
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:27,807
The job to be done could be
finding more effective methods

7
00:00:27,807 --> 00:00:29,727
of reaching our target audiences.

8
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:35,127
The existing alternatives for
this might be untargeted online,

9
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:38,962
banner advertising, or traditional
print and media advertising.



**CustomerModel.Example.FB.UVP**

1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,870
Now the unique value proposition
for students, the unique value

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,740
proposition might be something like
easily meet and connect with new

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,750
friends in a low social risk way.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,450
For advertisers, it could be
highly targeted advertising that

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,390
guarantees you better engagement
and a higher click through rate.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,670
You can see here that the unique
value propositions map directly

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,510
to the jobs to be done that each
different customer type has.

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,570
This is how you translate the need your
customer has into clearly articulated

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,460
value that you can provide for them.


**CustomerModel.Example.FB.Solution**
1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:04,251
And for the solution section, their
solution description needs to tie

2
00:00:04,251 --> 00:00:06,741
together both of their customer types.

3
00:00:07,071 --> 00:00:10,851
And also if Facebook was an impact
driven enterprise, it would need to

4
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:13,251
describe their impact activities as well.

5
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:17,541
Facebook's early solution
description would be something like.

6
00:00:17,946 --> 00:00:21,906
An online social media application
that creates a student social

7
00:00:21,906 --> 00:00:27,066
network, and that also provides a
highly targeted advertising platform.


**CustomerModel.Example.FB.Conclusion**
1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:03,891
You can see using the simple
example of Facebook that all of

2
00:00:03,891 --> 00:00:07,821
these sections of the canvas need
to fit together in a coherent way.

3
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:12,891
To form the customer model, they need
to clearly outline how the customer

4
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:17,571
model creates value for customers in a
way that Facebook can earn its revenue.

5
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:22,941
The value it creates for its users
by getting an important job done

6
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:27,351
for them in turn creates the ability
for Facebook to sell a different

7
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:29,961
kind of value to its advertisers.

8
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:33,891
All of these pieces need to work
together to create a powerful

9
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:35,631
customer model that can succeed.
