### Purpose
To engage users with a free program that can be shared and generate buzz. Make it a light-weight program that we can use to test some ideas about where the energy might be.
Goals:
1. Engage users and guide them to the broader SLC resource set
2. Experiment with our new tooling as it comes online
3. Create revenue opportunities 
4. Create investment opportunities off the back of traction with an audience





### Impact
Leave for now. Impact beyond TDB needs can be fleshed out in time.
