# The Improvement Process

<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 

Here's how to actually work through improving your customer model.

**First, gather input.** Talk with advisors, experts, and team members. Show them your canvas. Talk them through how your whole business model fits together, but focus in on your customer model. Gather feedback on where they think the weaknesses are and what improvements they'd suggest.

Use AI research tools to map your customer types and segments to predict whether they can provide the TAM and ARPU that your model needs. This gives you a high-level starting point.

Check the venture example library for ventures in similar spaces to yours. See how they found customer models that work.

**Second, work through systematically.** Work through your customer model in the same order you filled it in: Customers and Early Adopters, then Jobs to be Done and Existing Alternatives, then Unique Value Proposition, then Solution.

For each box, based on the ideas we've just talked through and feedback from advisors, brainstorm possible changes you could make. AI tools are really helpful here too. They can help you think broadly about different possibilities that you can then narrow in on.

`[MAIN PANEL: Customer Model section with boxes highlighted in sequence]`

**Third, test ripple effects.** For each idea you have that you think has potential, zoom out.

First, consider the rest of the customer model. How would these changes affect the flow of value creation? For example, if you changed the job to be done, would that require you to rethink the solution in order to serve that new customer need? Would it be MORE likely to get you to product-market fit?

Then, if it's looking positive, zoom out to your business model as a whole. What implications would this change have on your impact model and your economic model? What would have to change across your whole business model? Would this make your business model better as a whole?

Once you've done this, make a list of any high-potential ideas you've generated.

### Readiness Check

You're ready to move on when you can confidently answer these questions:

Can you clearly articulate your beachhead customer segment?

Does your TAM times ARPU show a path to sustainability?

Are you confident about the flow from customer segment to job to be done to unique value proposition to solution?

`[VISUAL TEXT: clear beachhead | TAM × ARPU works | confident flow]`

If yes, create a list of your core assumptions about this customer model. You'll need these when you start validating.

If you've discovered multiple compelling directions for your customer model, draft a separate Social Lean Canvas for each one. This gives you a stable place to work from as you develop your strategy.

Now let's move to your impact model.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
Here's how to actually work through
improving your customer model.

2
00:00:03,487 --> 00:00:07,837
First, gather input, talk with
advisors, experts, and team members.

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,201
Show them your canvas.

4
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:12,236
Talk them through how your whole
business model fits together,

5
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:14,162
but focus on the customer model.

6
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,742
Gather feedback on where they
think weaknesses are and what

7
00:00:17,742 --> 00:00:18,822
improvements they'd suggest.

8
00:00:19,714 --> 00:00:23,702
Use AI research tools to map your
customer types and segments to

9
00:00:23,702 --> 00:00:27,572
predict whether they can provide the
TAM and ARPU that your model needs.

10
00:00:27,784 --> 00:00:29,652
This gives you a high
level starting point.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,620
Check the venture example library for
ventures in similar spaces to yours.

12
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:37,128
See how they found
customer models that work.

13
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,121
Second, work through systematically
Work through your customer model in

14
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:43,831
the same order that you filled it in.

15
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:45,839
Customers and early adopters.

16
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:48,689
Then jobs to be done and
existing alternatives.

17
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:53,580
Then unique value proposition,
then solution for each box based

18
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,051
on the ideas we've just talked
through and feedback from advisors.

19
00:00:57,186 --> 00:00:59,916
Brainstorm possible changes
that you could make.

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,349
AI tools are really helpful here too.

21
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:05,542
They can help you think broadly
about different possibilities

22
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:07,057
that you can then narrow in on.

23
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:09,832
Third, test ripple effects.

24
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:13,372
For each idea that you think
has potential, zoom out.

25
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:16,118
First, consider the rest
of your customer model.

26
00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:19,083
How would these changes affect
the flow of value creation?

27
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:24,000
For example, if you changed the job
to be done, would that require you

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,443
to rethink the solution in order
to serve the new customer need?

29
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,240
Would it be more likely to get
you to product market fit or less?

30
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:35,372
Then if it's looking positive, zoom out
to your broader business model as a whole.

31
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:38,721
What implications would this
change have on your impact

32
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:40,476
model or your economic model?

33
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:43,544
What would have to change across
your whole business model?

34
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:46,646
Would this make your business
model stronger as a whole?

35
00:01:47,283 --> 00:01:50,898
Once you've done this, make a list of any
high potential ideas you've generated.

36
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:53,917
You're ready to move on.

37
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:58,245
When you can confidently answer these
questions, Can you clearly articulate

38
00:01:58,245 --> 00:01:59,775
your beachhead customer segment?

39
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:03,705
Does your TAM Times ARPU show
a path to sustainability?

40
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:08,382
Are you confident about the flow from
customer segment to job to be done, to

41
00:02:08,382 --> 00:02:10,572
unique value proposition to solution?

42
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:14,140
If yes, create a list of the
core assumptions that you're

43
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,580
making in your customer model.

44
00:02:15,638 --> 00:02:17,498
You'll need this when
you start validating.

45
00:02:18,746 --> 00:02:21,448
If you've discovered multiple
compelling directions for your

46
00:02:21,448 --> 00:02:25,186
customer model, draft a separate
social link canvas for each one.

47
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:30,039
This gives you a stable place to work from
as you develop these ideas into strategy.

48
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:32,875
Now let's move on to your impact model.
