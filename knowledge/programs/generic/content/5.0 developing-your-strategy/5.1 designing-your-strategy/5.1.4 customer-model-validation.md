## Section 5.1.4: Validating Your Customer Model

**Tag line: "Prove customers will pay"**

### Why Start Here

We start with customer model validation because your customer model is the engine of your business model.

`[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas - highlight Customer Model section]`

Without customers who will pay for your solution, nothing else can work. If you can create value for customers, there's a lot you can potentially change about your impact and economic models to evolve your business model into something that works.

But without an engine of value creation - without customers with important jobs to be done, who will engage with your unique value proposition and pay for your solution - you don't have much.

As a result, the biggest and most fundamental risk in your business model is very often that your customer model won't work.

### Building on Your Module 4 Work

In improving your business model , you worked through improving your customer model. You defined your beachhead segment. You calculated TAM times ARPU. You clarified the flow from customer segment to job to be done to unique value proposition to solution.

And critically, you identified the riskiest assumptions in your customer model.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Module 4 = improve model | Module 5 = prove it works]`

Now you're going to figure out to validate those assumptions. You're going to test whether what you believe about your customers is actually true.

### Customer Discovery: The Qualitative Phase

Customer Discovery is the first phase of validating your customer model. It's the qualitative journey into learning what you don't already know about your customers and evolving your customer model based on this learning.

`[MAIN PANEL: Customer Model section with components highlighted]`

You'll validate assumptions across all the components of your customer model. Let's walk through them.

**Customers and Early Adopters** - Are you targeting the right segment? Can you actually reach them? Where are your early adopters within this segment? What connects them?

**Jobs to be Done** - Is this job as important as you think? How are they currently trying to get it done? What's the pain when it doesn't work?

**Existing Alternatives** - What are they really using today? What would they have to give up to use your solution? What switching costs exist?

**Unique Value Proposition** - Does your value proposition resonate? Are you using the right language? Does it solve what they actually care about?

**Solution** - Is your solution the right way to deliver this value? What features matter most? What's missing?

`[VISUAL TEXT: customers | JTBD | alternatives | UVP | solution]`

The most powerful tool you have for Customer Discovery is the customer interview. Find people who fit your early adopter category and have structured conversations with them to explore these assumptions.

### How to Approach Customer Interviews

Keep these conversations open. Be an anthropologist. Don't pitch. Explore.

Don't ask "Do you struggle with X?" or "Will you pay X dollars for my product?" Instead, discover the need, pain, and motivation that will cause a customer to want to buy your product.

Ask them to walk you through how they navigate the use case you're aiming to help them with. Let them surface what's difficult about this. Ask them how they're currently solving the problems that come up.

`[VISUAL TEXT: don't pitch | explore | let them surface problems]`

This un-led exploration is the rich learning opportunity because you're hearing what they actually think, not shaped by what you want to hear.

If they don't mention the problem you're trying to solve for them, you can nudge them to explore that. But if nothing strong is emerging from the customer - this is really valuable information. It might mean you're not yet on the right track.

### Toast Ale: Customer Discovery Journey

Let's see what this looked like for our hypothetical Toast Ale founders at idea stage.

Remember, they're trying to validate assumptions about craft beer drinkers who care about sustainability. But they don't know yet if "surplus bread beer" will have stigma attached, what price point will work, or where people will buy it.

`[MAIN PANEL: Toast Ale customer model with assumption areas highlighted]`

**Validating Customers and Early Adopters**

They start by having conversations with craft beer enthusiasts at local bottle shops and beer festivals. They're exploring: Who cares most about sustainability in beer? What connects these people? Where do they hang out?

They discover a segment of environmentally conscious craft beer drinkers who are already seeking out sustainable brands. These people talk about carbon footprint, local sourcing, and brand values. The founders identify that the most passionate early adopters are people already buying from breweries with environmental missions.

**Validating Jobs to be Done and Existing Alternatives**

In conversations, they ask: "How do you think about environmental impact when you're choosing beer? What brands do you associate with sustainability?"

They learn that people want to feel good about their beer choices. They're already choosing organic beers, local breweries, and brands with environmental commitments. But food waste hasn't been a dimension people considered before.

**Validating Unique Value Proposition**

They test different framings of the value proposition. "Beer made from surplus bread." "Fighting food waste one beer at a time." "Award-winning beer that saves bread from landfill."

They discover that "waste bread" doesn't create stigma - it creates curiosity. People find the story compelling. The connection between bread and beer - both grains - makes intuitive sense. And the environmental angle resonates strongly.

**Validating Solution**

They bring homebrew samples to tastings. They watch reactions. They see if people come back for seconds.

They discover the beer needs to taste as good as premium craft beer - the sustainability angle won't carry a mediocre product. But when the beer is excellent, the surplus bread story becomes a powerful differentiator.

`[VISUAL TEXT: curiosity not stigma | story creates value | quality critical]`

Through twenty to thirty deep conversations and tastings, the founders evolve their understanding. They're not just validating - they're discovering insights that make the model stronger.

### Moving to Quantitative Validation

Once you've learned and evolved your customer model through Customer Discovery, it's time to develop quantitative experiments to test your customer model at scale.

`[MAIN PANEL: Transition from qualitative to quantitative]`

You're not discovering new insights anymore. You're proving that what you learned in qualitative validation works at the scale your business model requires.

### Types of Quantitative Experiments

Different experiments test different assumptions:

**Landing pages and pre-orders** - Test whether your value proposition converts at scale. Does the messaging that worked in conversations work online?

**Concierge MVP** - Deliver your solution manually at small scale. Proves people will use it and pay for it before you build infrastructure.

**Pilot sales through specific channels** - Test whether your channels can actually reach enough customers. What's the conversion rate? What's the cost to acquire a customer?

**Small batch production** - If you're making a physical product, produce a limited run and sell it through real channels.

`[VISUAL TEXT: landing pages | concierge MVP | pilot sales | small batches]`

These experiments start proving your economic model too. You're testing pricing, channels, and customer acquisition costs. This is why customer validation comes first - it unlocks economic validation.

### Toast Ale: Quantitative Validation

For Toast Ale, quantitative validation means proving the insights from Customer Discovery work at scale.

The founders brew a larger batch - five hundred bottles. They want to test whether the positioning that worked in tastings will work when people encounter the beer in a retail environment.

`[MAIN PANEL: Toast Ale bottle shop pilot setup]`

They place the beer in ten bottle shops across the city. They track:

**Acquisition and Activation** - How many people stop to look at the bottle? How many pick it up? How many buy? What's the conversion rate from "sees it" to "buys it"?

**Revenue** - Will people pay five dollars for a bottle? Is this price point sustainable across different customer segments?

**Channel effectiveness** - Do bottle shops work as a channel? What's the cost to get the beer into shops? How quickly does it move off shelves?

**Retention signals** - Do people come back for more? Do they ask retailers to stock it regularly?

The data either confirms their Customer Discovery insights or reveals gaps that need addressing.

If the conversion rate matches what they saw in tastings, they're onto something. If it's significantly lower, they need to understand why and iterate.

### Designing Your Validation Plan

Now take your risky assumptions from Module 4 and design specific experiments to test them.

For each assumption, ask:

What's the fastest, cheapest way to test this?

How can I test actual behavior, not stated preferences?

What would prove this assumption wrong? Be clear on your success criteria before you run the experiment.

Which assumptions are existential? Test those first.

`[VISUAL TEXT: fastest/cheapest | actual behavior | clear criteria | existential first]`

**Create your validation plan document.** List your experiments in priority order, starting with the riskiest assumptions. For each experiment, document:

- What assumption(s) it tests
- How you'll run it (method, participants, scale)
- Success criteria (what proves it right or wrong)
- Timeline and resources needed

**Sequence your experiments appropriately:**
- Start with Customer Discovery (qualitative interviews and exploration)
- Move to quantitative scale testing only after discovery insights are clear
- Note dependencies - some experiments require insights from earlier experiments

This plan becomes your input for building your strategy model.

Now lets work on validating your impact model


1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,141
we start with customer model validation
because your customer model is

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:05,611
the engine of your business model.

3
00:00:06,051 --> 00:00:09,771
Without customers who will pay for
your solution, nothing else will work.

4
00:00:10,023 --> 00:00:13,129
If you can create value for
customers, there's a lot that

5
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:16,189
can change about the rest of your
business model to get it to work,

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,168
but without an engine of value creation,
without customers, with important jobs to

7
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:25,116
be done, who will engage with your value
proposition and pay for your solution?

8
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:26,342
You don't have anything.

9
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:29,877
As a result, the biggest and
most fundamental risk in your

10
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:33,430
business model is very often that
your customer model won't work

11
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:35,511
in improving your business model.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,823
You work through improving
your customer model.

13
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:42,671
You defined your beachhead segment,
you calculated tam times, arpu, you

14
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:46,331
clarified the flow from customer
segment to job to be done, to unique

15
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:48,041
value proposition to solution.

16
00:00:48,538 --> 00:00:51,338
And critically, you identified
the riskiest assumptions

17
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:52,508
in your customer model.

18
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:55,948
Now you're gonna figure out how
to validate those assumptions.

19
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:58,275
You're gonna attest whether
what you believe about your

20
00:00:58,275 --> 00:00:59,480
customers is actually true.

21
00:01:00,606 --> 00:01:04,407
Customer discovery is the first phase
of validation for your customer model.

22
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:09,083
It's the qualitative journey into learning
what you don't already know about your

23
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,336
customers evolving your customer model.

24
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:14,943
Based on this learning, You'll
validate assumptions across all the

25
00:01:14,943 --> 00:01:16,533
components of your customer model.

26
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:19,405
Let's walk through them,
customers and early adopters.

27
00:01:19,494 --> 00:01:21,264
Are you targeting the right segments?

28
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,808
Can you actually reach them?

29
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:25,532
Where are your early
adopters within the segment?

30
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:26,985
What connects them together?

31
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,130
Jobs to be done.

32
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:30,803
Is this job to be done as
important as you think?

33
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:33,491
how are customers currently
trying to get the job done?

34
00:01:33,613 --> 00:01:35,587
What's the pain when it
doesn't work for them?

35
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:36,933
Existing alternatives?

36
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:38,568
What are they already using today?

37
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:41,082
What would they have to give
up to use your solution?

38
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:42,548
What are the switching costs?

39
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,214
Unique value proposition?

40
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:46,008
Does your value proposition resonate?

41
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:48,127
Are you using the right language?

42
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,369
Does it solve what they
actually care about?

43
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:51,352
Solution?

44
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:54,015
Is your solution the right
way to deliver this value?

45
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:56,239
What features matter
most to your customers?

46
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:56,989
What's missing?

47
00:01:57,935 --> 00:02:00,631
The most powerful tool you
have for customer discovery

48
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:01,681
is the customer interview.

49
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,580
Find people who fit your early
adopter category  and have

50
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,000
structured conversations with
them to explore these assumptions.

51
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:11,106
Keep these conversations open.

52
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,403
Be an anthropologist.

53
00:02:12,403 --> 00:02:13,993
Don't pitch, explore.

54
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:16,389
Don't ask, do you struggle with X?

55
00:02:16,457 --> 00:02:18,617
Will you pay X dollars for my product?

56
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,103
Instead, discover the need, the pain,
and the motivation that will cause your

57
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:24,933
customer to want to buy your product.

58
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:28,439
Ask them to walk through how
they navigate the use case that

59
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,699
you're aiming to help them with.

60
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:30,927
Let them surface.

61
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:32,397
What's difficult about this?

62
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:35,211
Ask them how they're currently
solving the problems that come up.

63
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:40,494
This Unled exploration is the rich
learning opportunity because you're

64
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:44,358
hearing what they actually think,
not shaped by what you want to hear.

65
00:02:44,835 --> 00:02:47,879
If they don't mention the problem
that you are trying to solve for them,

66
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:49,761
you can nudge them to explore that.

67
00:02:49,977 --> 00:02:53,076
But if nothing strong is emerging
from the customer, this is

68
00:02:53,076 --> 00:02:54,546
really valuable information.

69
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:57,311
It might mean that you're
not yet on the right track.

70
00:02:57,938 --> 00:03:00,933
Let's see what this look like
for our hypothetical toe ale.

71
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:02,613
Founders at idea stage.

72
00:03:02,963 --> 00:03:06,486
Remember, they're trying to validate
assumptions about craft beer drinkers

73
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,076
who care about sustainability.

74
00:03:08,342 --> 00:03:12,867
But they don't know yet if surplus bread
beer will have a stigma attached to it.

75
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,257
What price point will work,  or
where people will buy it.

76
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:20,830
They start by having conversations
with craft beer enthusiasts at local

77
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,660
bottle shops and beer festivals.

78
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:26,385
They're exploring who cares most
about sustainability and beer?

79
00:03:26,617 --> 00:03:27,936
What connects these people?

80
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:29,076
Where do they hang out?

81
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:33,468
they discover a segment of environmentally
conscious craft beer drinkers who are

82
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:37,680
already seeking sustainable brands,
These people talk about carbon footprint,

83
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,861
local sourcing, and brand values.

84
00:03:40,157 --> 00:03:43,328
The founders identify that the
most passionate early adopters

85
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:46,491
are already buying from breweries
with environmental missions.

86
00:03:46,854 --> 00:03:50,129
In conversations they ask, how
do you think about environmental

87
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,509
impact when you're choosing beer?

88
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:54,281
What brands do you associate
with sustainability?

89
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,640
They learn that people want to
feel good about their beer choices.

90
00:03:57,828 --> 00:04:01,717
They're already choosing organic
beers, local breweries and brands

91
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:03,157
with environmental commitments.

92
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:06,772
But food waste isn't a dimension
that people have considered before.

93
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:09,777
They test different framings
of the value proposition.

94
00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:12,360
Beer made from surplus
bread, Fighting food.

95
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,740
Waste one beer at a time.

96
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:16,351
Award-winning beer saves
bread from landfill.

97
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:19,508
They discover that waste
beer doesn't create stigma.

98
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,000
It creates curiosity.

99
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:24,734
People find the story compelling,  The
connection between bread and beer.

100
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:29,403
Both grains make intuitive sense and the
environmental angle resonates strongly.

101
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,073
They bring home brew samples to tastings.

102
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,231
They watch reactions they see
if people come back for seconds.

103
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:39,112
They discover the beer needs to
taste as good as premium craft beer.

104
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,417
The sustainability angle won't carry
a mediocre product, but when the beer

105
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:47,229
is excellent, the surplus bread story
becomes a powerful differentiator.

106
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:51,319
Through 20 or 30 deep conversations
and tastings, the founders

107
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,669
evolve their understanding.

108
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:54,539
They're not just validating.

109
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:57,149
They're discovering insights
that make the model stronger.

110
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,943
Once you've learned and evolved
your customer model through customer

111
00:05:00,943 --> 00:05:04,923
discovery, it's time to develop
quantitative experiments to test your

112
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:08,777
customer model At scale, you're not
discovering new insights anymore.

113
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:13,118
You are proving that what you learned the
qualitative validation works at the scale.

114
00:05:13,118 --> 00:05:17,202
Your business model requires different
experiments, test different assumptions.

115
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:20,021
Landing pages and pre-order   tests.

116
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:22,990
Test whether your value
proposition converts at scale.

117
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:26,481
Does the messaging that worked
in conversations work online?

118
00:05:26,856 --> 00:05:31,694
concierge MVPs Will you deliver a version
of your solution manually and at small

119
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:36,321
scale proves people will use it and pay
for it before you build infrastructure,

120
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:38,193
pilot sales through specific channels.

121
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:42,194
Test whether your channels can
actually reach enough customers.

122
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,495
What's the conversion rate?

123
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:45,445
What's the cost to acquire a customer?

124
00:05:45,836 --> 00:05:50,191
Small batch production, if you're making
a physical product, produces a limited run

125
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:52,051
that you can sell through real channels.

126
00:05:52,429 --> 00:05:55,609
These experiments start to prove
your economic model as well.

127
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,149
You're testing pricing channels
and customer acquisition costs.

128
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:01,681
This is why customer
validation comes first.

129
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:07,737
It unlocks economic validation later on
For Toast Ale, quantitative validation

130
00:06:07,737 --> 00:06:12,403
means proving the insights from customer
discovery work at scale, The Founders

131
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:14,653
brew a large batch, 500 bottles.

132
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:18,653
They want to test whether the positioning
that worked in tastings  will work.

133
00:06:18,653 --> 00:06:22,386
When people encounter the beer in a
retail environment, they place the beer

134
00:06:22,386 --> 00:06:24,276
in 10 bottle shops across the city.

135
00:06:24,392 --> 00:06:26,642
They track acquisition and activation.

136
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:28,742
How many people stop
to look at the bottle?

137
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:29,945
How many pick it up?

138
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:30,995
How many buy?

139
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:35,287
What's the conversion rate from
Seize it to buys it revenue?

140
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:39,146
Will people  Is this price
point sustainable across

141
00:06:39,146 --> 00:06:40,496
different customer segments?

142
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:42,287
Channel effectiveness.

143
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:43,937
Do bottle shops work as a channel?

144
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:46,449
What's the cost to get beer into shops?

145
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:48,729
How quickly does it move off the shelves?

146
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,454
Retention signals?

147
00:06:50,692 --> 00:06:52,012
Do people come back for more?

148
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:54,433
Do they ask retailers
to stock it regularly?

149
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,463
The data either confirms their
customer discovery insights or it

150
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:00,233
reveals gaps that need addressing.

151
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:04,440
If the conversion rate matches what they
saw in tastings, they're onto something.

152
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,007
If it's significantly lower, they
need to understand why and iterate.

153
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:10,603
Now.

154
00:07:10,603 --> 00:07:15,073
Take your risky assumptions from the
improving your business model module and

155
00:07:15,073 --> 00:07:17,503
design specific experiments to test them.

156
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,730
For each assumption, ask, what's the
fastest, cheapest way to test this?

157
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:25,107
Can I test actual behavior,
not stated preferences.

158
00:07:25,342 --> 00:07:27,400
What would prove this assumption wrong?

159
00:07:27,766 --> 00:07:31,156
Be clear on your success criteria
before you run the experiment.

160
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:35,713
create your validation plan,
document, list your experiments,

161
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:38,803
and priority order, starting with
the riskiest assumptions first.

162
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:44,338
For each experiment document what
assumptions it tests, how you run it.

163
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,663
Method participants
scale success criteria.

164
00:07:47,723 --> 00:07:49,163
What proves it right or wrong?

165
00:07:49,347 --> 00:07:51,055
Timeline and resources needed.

166
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:54,282
Sequence your experiments appropriately.

167
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:56,112
Start with customer discovery.

168
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,362
Qualitative interviews and exploration.

169
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:02,741
Move to quantitative scale testing only
after discovery insights are clear.

170
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:06,359
This plan becomes your input for
building your strategy model.

171
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,021
Now let's move on to
validating your impact model.
