# Unique Value Proposition

**Quick Definition**: The benefits customers get from using your product or service - how you uniquely address their specific jobs to be done.

**Key Insight**: Focus on customer outcomes and benefits, not product features. This is where you demonstrate deep understanding of what customers truly value and why they'd choose you over alternatives.
