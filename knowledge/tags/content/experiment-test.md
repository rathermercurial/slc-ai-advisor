# experiment-test

## Definition
The `experiment-test` tag identifies content about testing and validation methodologies used to validate assumptions, test hypotheses, and gather evidence for canvas components and business model elements.

## Usage Criteria
Apply this tag to content that:
- Provides testing and validation frameworks
- Discusses experimental design for business model validation
- Offers hypothesis testing methodologies
- Analyzes validation approaches and results

## Always Include When
- Content focuses on validation and testing methodologies
- Experimental design for assumption testing
- Hypothesis-driven validation approaches
- Evidence gathering and analysis frameworks

## Never Include When
- General research methods not specific to business model validation
- Academic research approaches not applied to venture validation
- Testing content not related to assumption or hypothesis validation

## Required Combinations
- Often combined with `assumption-risk` for assumption validation
- May include canvas section tags for section-specific testing approaches

## Content Examples
- Lean startup validation methodologies
- Customer validation frameworks
- Impact measurement and validation approaches
- Business model testing strategies

## Related Tags
- Often appears with `assumption-risk` for assumption testing
- May combine with `early-adopters` for early validation approaches
- Often paired with `venture-stage-model` for stage-appropriate testing
- May appear with any canvas section for section-specific validation

## Key Concepts
- Hypothesis-driven development
- Minimum viable products/experiments
- Evidence-based validation
- Customer development and validation
- Impact validation approaches
- Iterative testing and learning
