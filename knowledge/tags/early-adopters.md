# early-adopters

## Definition
The `early-adopters` tag identifies content about early adopters - the initial, most motivated subgroup within customer segments who are crucial for initial testing and validation.

## Usage Criteria
Apply this tag to content that:
- Defines early adopter characteristics
- Provides guidance on identifying early adopters
- Discusses early adopter engagement strategies
- Analyzes early adopter validation approaches

## Always Include When
- Content specifically focuses on early adopter identification
- Early adopter validation methodologies
- Early adopter characteristics and profiles
- Early adopter engagement strategies

## Never Include When
- Content is about customers generally (use `customers` instead)
- Content about later-stage customer acquisition
- General product-market fit content not specific to early adopters

## Required Combinations
- Must include appropriate canvas-sections hierarchy: [customer-model, customers, early-adopters]
- Often combined with venture-stage tags for stage-specific guidance

## Content Examples
- Early adopter identification frameworks
- Early adopter profile templates
- Early adopter validation methodologies
- Early adopter case study analysis

## Related Tags
- Parent tags: [customers](../customers.md), [customer-model](../../customer-model.md)
- Often appears with `idea-stage` or `early-stage` venture-stage tags
- May combine with `experiment-test` content tags for validation approaches
- Often paired with assumption-risk for validation-related risks

## Key Concepts
- Most motivated customer subset
- Willing to try imperfect solutions
- Provide crucial early feedback
- Bridge to broader market adoption
- Different characteristics than mainstream customers
