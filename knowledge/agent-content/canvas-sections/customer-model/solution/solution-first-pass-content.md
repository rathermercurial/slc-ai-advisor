### Solution

The last section to fill in your customer model is the solution section. This is the part of the canvas where you describe what your enterprise actually does, your product or service. Your solution is what's going to deliver the value to your customers in a way that at least some of them will pay for.

As well as this, your solution needs to deliver the social or environmental impact that's mapped out in your impact model. So make sure that you describe the parts of your solution that will deliver the activities in your impact model.

Keep the description of your solution simple and high level. You don't need to go into great detail, but make sure that you cover off the key aspects of it so that it clearly shows both how you're going to create customer value and impact.
