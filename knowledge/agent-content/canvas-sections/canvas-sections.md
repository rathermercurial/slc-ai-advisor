# Canvas Sections

The Canvas Section contains the core components of the Social Lean Canvas framework. These elements work together to provide a comprehensive view of how an enterprise creates customer value, delivers social/environmental impact, and maintains financial sustainability.

## Core Framework Components

### [Purpose](purpose/purpose.md)
A clear, inspirational, and concise statement defining the fundamental social or environmental problem the enterprise aims to solve.

### [Customer Model](customer-model/customer-model.md)
Describes how the enterprise creates value for its customers, encompassing customers, jobs to be done, solutions, and value propositions.

### [Impact Model](impact-model/impact-model.md)
Illustrates how the enterprise's activities translate purpose into tangible, measurable social or environmental outcomes through a chain of causality.

### [Economic Model](economic-model/economic-model.md)
Clarifies how customer value creation translates into a financially sustainable operation through channels, revenue, costs, and strategic advantages.

### [Key Metrics](key-metrics/key-metrics.md)
Quantitative measures indicating the current state of the enterprise's customer, economic, and impact models.

## Integration

These five components are designed to work together:
- **Purpose** provides the foundational motivation
- **Customer Model** defines value creation
- **Impact Model** maps purpose to outcomes  
- **Economic Model** ensures sustainability
- **Key Metrics** track progress across all models

The interconnected nature ensures alignment between financial success and social/environmental impact.



# **Social Lean Canvas: Core Framework Description**

  

The **Social Lean Canvas** is a widely adopted strategic framework designed to help build and model enterprises that deliver social or environmental impact through sustainable business models. It provides a structured approach, integrating purpose-driven thinking into traditional business model elements, enabling clarity, simplicity, and iterative improvement.

  

The canvas comprises three interconnected models:

1. **Customer Model**
    
2. **Impact Model**
    
3. **Economic Model**
    

  

Each model consists of distinct sections designed to help entrepreneurs clearly define and refine their enterprise's core logic.

## **Canvas Structure and Terminology**

  

### **Purpose**

  

A clear, inspirational, and concise statement defining the fundamental social or environmental problem the enterprise aims to solve. This is the foundational intention guiding the entire canvas.

  

### **Customer Model**

  

Describes how the enterprise creates value for its customers, encompassing four sections:

- **Customers:** Individuals or organizations essential to the enterprise's operation. Categorized by:
    
    - **Customer Types:** Distinct roles customers play (e.g., users, buyers, funders, sponsors).
        
    - **Customer Segments:** Specific subgroups within each customer type targeted for value delivery.
        
    
- **Early Adopters:** The initial, most motivated subgroup within each segment, crucial for initial testing and validation.
    
- **Jobs to be Done:** The core tasks or needs motivating customers to engage with the solution.
    
- **Existing Alternatives:** Current solutions or competitors addressing the same jobs, highlighting both market validation and competitive landscape.
    
- **Unique Value Proposition (UVP):** The distinct benefit provided to each customer type, directly addressing their specific jobs to be done.
    
- **Solution:** A simple, high-level description of the actual product or service that delivers customer value and creates impact.
    

  

### **Impact Model**

  

Illustrates how the enterprise's activities translate purpose into tangible, measurable social or environmental outcomes. Structured as a chain of causality:

- **Issue:** A clear articulation of the social or environmental problem identified in the purpose.
    
- **Participants:** Key stakeholders directly involved or impacted by the enterprise's activities (may overlap with customers).
    
- **Activities:** Specific actions taken by or involving participants, designed to initiate impact (also reflected in the solution).
    
- **Short-Term Outcomes:** Immediate, measurable changes resulting directly from activities.
    
- **Medium-Term Outcomes:** Subsequent, measurable effects (1-2 years) building from short-term outcomes.
    
- **Long-Term Outcomes:** Sustained, positive changes over an extended period (2-10 years).
    
- **Impact:** The ultimate state of change reflecting successful realization of the enterprise's purpose, typically broad and inspirational.
    

  

### **Economic Model**

  

Clarifies how customer value creation translates into a financially sustainable operation:

- **Channels:** Mechanisms to scale customer acquisition (marketing channels) and product/service distribution (distribution channels).
    
- **Revenue:** Regular income sources at scale (sales, donations, grants, sponsorship).
	
- **Costs:** Major ongoing expenses necessary to deliver the solution and achieve impact (production, marketing, distribution, impact activities).
        Note - revenue and costs are collectively seen as the financial model
    
- **Advantage (Leverage & Innovation):** The specific strategic strengths or leverage points enabling financial viability and long-term success. Examples include unique resources, network effects, intellectual property, or beneficial financial terms.
    

  

### **Key Metrics**

  

Quantitative measures indicating the current state of the enterprise's customer, economic, and impact models. Metrics evolve with progress, reflecting validation of core assumptions and dynamics such as:

- Customer engagement or growth
    
- Early impact outcomes
    
- Efficiency or scale of customer acquisition channels

## **Key Concepts & Definitions for Consistent Usage**

- **Purpose Statement:**
    
    An inspirational and concise articulation of the core issue motivating the enterprise.
    
- **Customer Types vs. Segments:**
    
    - **Customer Types:** Broad categories defined by their role in the business model (e.g., users, funders).
        
    - **Customer Segments:** Specific subsets within these types (e.g., stay-at-home parents as users).
        
    
- **Jobs to be Done (JTBD):**
    
    The underlying tasks, needs, or motivations driving customers to use the enterprise's solution.
    
- **Unique Value Proposition (UVP):**
    
    The explicitly communicated benefit customers receive, directly aligned with their JTBD.
    
- **Early Adopters:**
    
    Initial targeted customer subgroups most responsive to the solution, essential for early feedback and iteration.
    
- **Impact Chain of Causality:**
    
    The logical, sequential link from activities through short, medium, and long-term outcomes to ultimate impact.
    
- **Channels:**
    
    Pathways for acquiring customers and delivering products/services at scale:
    
    - **Customer Acquisition Channels:** Marketing and outreach mechanisms.
        
    - **Distribution Channels:** Methods to deliver the actual solution.
        
    
- **Advantage (Leverage & Innovation):**
    
    Strategic factors or resources granting the enterprise sustainable economic viability and competitive positioning.
