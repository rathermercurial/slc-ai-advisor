### Unique Value Proposition

Your unique value proposition describes the benefits that your customers are gonna get from using your product or service. A UVP is based on the particular job that your customer is trying to get done and the special way that you are gonna do this job for them.

This is not the same thing as the solution section of the canvas where you describe your product or service. This is about describing the benefit that your customer will get from using your product or service.

If you have more than one customer type, you will have a different job to be done for each customer type. And likewise, you will have a different unique value proposition for each as well. Number or color code these in the same way that you did in the jobs to be done section.

The unique value proposition section is where you demonstrate that you have deeply understood your customers. You have understood what they are trying to achieve, what value they're trying to get and how to talk to them about it.
