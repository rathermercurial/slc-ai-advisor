## Program name: "Pivoting to/towards/into purpose"

## Trailer

Perhaps consider adding access to the example library. 

**Core memes:** 
1. Pivoting to Purpose - the decision and the intent
2. Honest Hustle - the mode that gets real about what this is going to take
3. Build a Machine - the lever that makes everything possible (build wealth and do good)
4. Authenticity - This is not about me giving them the answers. It is about giving them the tools to find their own answers. It is about them feeling like they are becoming capable entrepreneurs. 

A core vibe is Authenticity. This is about getting real about what needs to be done and why it matters. Not exaggerating claims, but being positive. Giving people the feeling that they are getting better and more capable AND that they will succeed. Not that I am somehow giving them the answers. Just the tools for them to find the answers. 

## Memetic Language
1. A **Purpose Pivot** is the personal transformation from employee to solo founder. It’s the moment you stop trading time for wages and start building a machine that aligns money, meaning, and freedom. It’s a phrase that resonates instantly with anyone considering their “next chapter.”
	1. **Variants / Extensions**
		- Pivot to Purpose (verb form, action-oriented)
		- Pivot Point (the decisive moment)
		- Purpose Pivoting, pivoting to purpose (ongoing process, implies agility and reinvention)
	2. **Psychological Resonance**
		- Feels **decisive, hopeful, directional**.
		- Names the _moment of courage_ people already sense inside themselves.
		- Strong metaphor from sports and startups: pivot = agility, strategy, survival.
		- Implies breaking from the old system, _into something more aligned_.
	3. **Memetic Usage**
	- _“I made my Purpose Pivot last year.”_
	- _“She’s pivoting to purpose.”_
	- Could even be used by others as a label: _“They’re in the middle of a pivot.”_
2.  **The Honest Hustle**
	1. **Core:** _The Honest Hustle_- “Build without the bullshit. Work that makes money and makes sense.”_
	2.  **Variants / Extensions**
		- **Hustle, Honest** (shortened slogan-style)
		- **Hustle Without the Hustle** (ironic, cheeky)
		- 
3. **Psychological Resonance**
	- Takes back a word (_hustle_) that has been poisoned by hustle-bro culture.
    - **Honesty** is the counterweight: conveys _clean, transparent, integrity-driven_.
    - Appeals to people who feel _burnt by scams, hype, and get-rich-quick schemes_.
    - Sounds gritty, real, and accessible. - _“This isn’t guru BS — this is the Honest Hustle.”_

**Comparative Vibe**
- **The Purpose Pivot** → _Agility & Direction_. Names the moment of change. Optimistic, dynamic, startup-y.
- **The Honest Hustle** → _Integrity & Realness_. Names the day-to-day grind, cleansed of hype. Relatable, gritty.
