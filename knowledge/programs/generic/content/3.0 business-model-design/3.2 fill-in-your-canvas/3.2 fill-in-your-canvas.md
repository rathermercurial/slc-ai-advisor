### Your Turn to Build

In this module, we'll walk you through developing your business model in the Social Lean Canvas.

You'll get an overview of the whole canvas, then we'll guide you through filling in each of the key sections.

### What You'll Cover

We'll work through the three integrated models.

First, your Customer Model - how you create and deliver value to your customers.

`[MAIN PANEL: Highlight Customer Model section]`

Second, your Impact Model - how your activities will deliver meaningful change in the world.

`[MAIN PANEL: Highlight Impact Model section]`

And third, your Economic Model - how you can achieve financial sustainability and success.

Work through each section in order. The program will guide you through each step.

### Support Along the Way

As you work, use the Venture Example Library to see what other ventures did when building their business models. See their choices, their approaches and their trade-offs.

### Start Simple

For your first pass through the canvas, keep it simple and high-level. Getting the structure right is important at the start. You can flesh out the detail later.

If you're in the early stages of developing your venture, use back of the napkin numbers. What's your best starting guess about how your business model will work? Start simple, then add complexity later on.

### Ready to Begin

Good luck!
