KeyMetrics

  

1. The key metrics section is a little different from the rest of the canvas. It is the place where you capture a handful of key numbers or ratios that show the current state of progress of your enterprise.
    
2. While the rest of the canvas shows what you think will be the case that is - mostly, yet to be validated assumptions about how you think your business model will work at scale, your Key Metrics allow you to show a snapshot of your progress towards in developing this business model
    

3. Make sure you include at least one Key Metric for each of your customer, impact and economic models
    
4. Choose metrics that show evidence of the key dynamics you are trying to prove as you develop your enterprise
    
5. For example:
    

6. For your customer model - it might be a metric that tracks the increase in new signups to your educational programme - showing that your unique value proposition is working - what we call problem solution fit
    
7. For your impact model it might be a metric that tracks some early outcomes that you are measuring from testing parts of your impact model
    
8. For your economic model, it might be a metric that shows that your ability to reach customers at scale through your main marketing channel.
    

9. These key metrics will change as you progress and will also differ greatly depending on the type of enterprise you are building and the stage you are at on the journey.
    
10. But fundamentally they will reflect the strategy you are taking to prove that this is going to work.**
