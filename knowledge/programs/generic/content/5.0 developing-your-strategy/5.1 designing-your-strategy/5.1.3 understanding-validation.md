## Section 5.1.3: Understanding Validation (REVISED v2)

**Tag line: "Test, learn, evolve"**

### Building on What You Know

You've already encountered validation earlier in this program. In the business model design module, we talked about how successful ventures evolve through testing and iteration.

And in the improving your business model module, you identified the riskiest assumptions in your customer, impact, and economic models. You created lists of what needs to be validated.

Now we're going to build on that foundation. We're going to turn those lists of risky assumptions into a systematic validation strategy.

### The Validation Journey

No successful venture ended up with the exact business model it started with. Every successful business model changes and evolves as founders discover insights that make it better.

The goal with validation is for this not to be a haphazard process. Not trial and error where getting things wrong destroys your venture.

Validation is the methodical process where you gain the benefits of learning without destroying your venture in the process.

`[MAIN PANEL: Build-Measure-Learn cycle diagram]`

We call this Build, Measure, and Learn. You build an experiment. You measure the results. You learn from what happened. Then you build the next experiment, informed by what you learned.

`[VISUAL TEXT: build → measure → learn → build]`

Remember those risky assumption lists you created in the improving your business model module? Those become your validation roadmap. Each assumption gets tested through this cycle until you've removed the biggest risks from your business model.

### In the Early Stages, Validation IS Progress

Here's something critical to understand: In the early stages of your venture, validation equals progress.

You're not executing yet. You're not scaling. You're learning. And learning is the work.

Your progress isn't measured in revenue or customers served or impact created. It's measured in assumptions tested, insights gained, and risks removed.

### What Good Validation Looks Like

Good validation has three key characteristics.

`[VISUAL TEXT: fastest/cheapest | based on reality | riskiest first]`

**First: It's the fastest, cheapest way to prove or disprove a theory.**

Don't build when you can sketch. Don't sketch when you can ask. Don't invest months and thousands of dollars when you can get an answer in a week for a few hundred.



Each step answers questions at the appropriate level of investment.

**Second: It's based on reality as much as possible.**

Asking people "Would you buy this?" isn't validation. People lie. Not maliciously - they just tell you what they think you want to hear. Or what they aspirationally believe about themselves rather than what they actually do.

Good validation is based on what people actually do, not what they say they'll do.


**Third: You start by testing the riskiest assumptions first.**

You identified these risky assumptions in the previous module. Some of them create existential threats to your business model. If they turn out to be wrong, the whole model fails. Others can be navigated around if needed.

Test the existential risks first. Only after you're confident the foundation is solid do you test the smaller risks.


### Optimization Comes Later

Once you've validated the critical assumptions and your business model is starting to work, you'll transition to optimization mode.

That's where you make many small improvements. Testing different pricing points. Refining your messaging. Optimizing your channels. You'll do this forever - continuous improvement.

But don't confuse early-stage validation with optimization. Don't fall into the trap of premature optimization - perfecting things that don't matter yet while ignoring the existential questions.

`[VISUAL TEXT: first validate it works | then optimize how well]`

The Toast Ale founders shouldn't be investing in branded glassware or perfecting label design before they know if anyone will buy the beer. They shouldn't be building distributor relationships before they've proven people want the product.

First validate. Then optimize.

### Two Types of Validation

There are two types of validation you'll use, and understanding the difference matters.

`[MAIN PANEL: Qualitative vs Quantitative comparison diagram]`

**Qualitative validation is high-bandwidth exploration.**

You're having deep, open-ended conversations. You're observing behavior. You're discovering things you didn't know you needed to know.

This is where you learn the language customers use to describe their problems. The words that resonate. The frames that make sense to them. You're looking for non-obvious insights that unlock your business model's potential.

You're also learning about the customer segment itself. What connects these people? What themes cut across the group? Where might early adopters be hiding?

Be an anthropologist. Don't interrogate. Don't pitch. Explore. You don't know what you don't know, and qualitative validation lets you discover it.
 

They're listening for the frameworks, the language, the motivations. They might discover that "waste bread" positioning is actually compelling - it tells a story. Or they might discover it creates concerns about quality. Either way, they learn.

**Quantitative validation is narrow, focused proof at scale.**

You've learned something in qualitative validation. Now you need to prove it works at the scale your business model requires.

Where qualitative might involve twenty deep conversations, quantitative might involve a thousand quick interactions. An email campaign. A landing page. A small production run sold through specific channels.

You're not discovering new insights here. You're confirming what you learned works in practice, at scale, with numbers that matter.

`[VISUAL TEXT: qualitative = high-bandwidth discovery | quantitative = scaled proof]`

  

### The Sequence: Qualitative First

You almost always start with qualitative validation.

`[VISUAL TEXT: qualitative = discover | quantitative = prove at scale]`

This is because the biggest risks often live in your customer model, and customer understanding requires qualitative work first. You need to understand the humans before you can scale the numbers.

Qualitative is also usually faster and cheaper. You don't need infrastructure. You don't need to build product. You just need to find people and talk with them.

But here's the truth: this can feel uncomfortable at first.

If you're comfortable with conversations, this will feel natural. If approaching strangers makes you uncomfortable, that's normal. The discomfort actually means you're doing something valuable - you're learning things that matter, things you can't learn any other way.

It gets easier with practice.

This is founder work. You can't delegate these early conversations. You need to experience customers firsthand. You need to hear their exact words, see their reactions, feel their hesitations.

Only founders can do the creative work of fitting new insights into the business model and seeing if it makes it stronger.

For the Toast Ale founders, this means getting out and talking to craft beer drinkers. Visiting bakeries to understand their surplus bread situation. Having conversations in bottle shops. Running informal taste tests.

It's uncomfortable at first. It gets easier. And the insights you gain are worth it.

Then, once you've discovered insights through qualitative work, you move to quantitative validation. You test whether what worked in twenty conversations works at scale

### A Note on Intellectual Property

Before we dive in, a quick word about intellectual property concerns.

One question that often comes up is: "How can I validate my business model without risking someone stealing my IP?"

Here are a few thoughts that will help you consider how to approach this.

First, most people aren't interested in your idea. We often put way too much stock in our ideas being unique. Generally speaking, there will always be many people already working on the same ideas as we are.

Second, your idea at the start is not good enough to bother copying. Most ideas in the beginning are pretty obvious and not very valuable. Their value comes when you start validating them and learning nuanced insights from your customers and evolving the product around these insights.

Because of this, even if someone tried to copy your idea, they wouldn't have your deep customer insights shaping the evolution of the product. Just what they see in the current snapshot.

Third, when we hide, we lose the value of having a community help us. We miss all the opportunities for feedback, advice, support, recruitment, investment, and so on that could arise if we were out talking about what we're doing.

`[VISUAL TEXT: most ideas aren't unique | value comes from insights | hiding limits help]`

That said, there are times when an idea does represent intellectual property and should be protected. This is especially true when it comes out of academic research or is a physical invention of some kind, or involves specific materials and formulations.

If you're working on one of these, then definitely take IP protection seriously. If this is the case, there are a few things to consider:

What can you do to protect your IP so that you can speak about it?

What can you share that will help you validate your product or service without sharing your IP? You can validate a customer segment, their jobs to be done, and the unique value proposition they'll respond to without ever needing to tell them what the solution is. You could tell them what the solution does without showing them how it works.

You could share enough to get a customer or investor interested, and then insist on them signing an NDA before giving them deeper insight into how it works.

Generally speaking though, intellectual property is not often an actual concern. And social entrepreneurs being overly protective of their ideas in the mistaken belief that they need to protect their IP is a much more likely cause for a venture to fail.

But if you are worried, do seek expert advice that is specific to what you're doing.

### Your Validation Plan

In the next three sections, you'll build validation plans for each of your models - customer first, then impact, then economic.

`[MAIN PANEL: Three-part validation journey diagram]`

Each follows the same principles we've just covered - fastest and cheapest, based on reality, riskiest first. But each focuses on different risks and uses different approaches.

Customer model validation centers on discovery and product-market fit. Impact model validation proves your theory of change works. Economic model validation tests whether the business model can scale.

Together, they give you a complete validation strategy.
