## 4. Impact Model

### Issue

**Issue Detailed Analysis**: 
The core issue OSE addresses is artificial material scarcity created by proprietary technology systems that concentrate productive power in the hands of few actors while maintaining artificial constraints on access to essential tools and knowledge. This manifests as expensive industrial equipment that communities cannot afford, proprietary restrictions that prevent repair and modification, and technological dependency that undermines local resilience and self-determination. The problem extends beyond economics to include environmental degradation from inefficient centralized production, social inequality from unequal access to productive capacity, and innovation stagnation from competitive secrecy and patent restrictions. Resource conflicts arise when scarcity is artificially maintained through intellectual property restrictions and monopolistic practices. The issue represents a systemic failure where human potential is constrained by institutional arrangements that prioritize extraction over abundance, dependency over autonomy, and competition over collaboration. This creates vulnerability to supply chain disruptions, limits community resilience, and perpetuates global inequality by preventing distributed development of productive capacity.
