# **Purpose Pivot Venture Typology (P2P)**

  


Welcome! This is the Purpose Pivot Venture Typology — a practical map of the small, sustainable venture types that solo founders and tiny teams use today. It helps you understand the main approaches available, see real examples of each type, and spark ideas for how your own venture could work or evolve.

  

This list is not exhaustive. Founders are endlessly creative, and AI continues to change what’s possible. New variations appear all the time — sometimes even completely new categories. If your idea isn’t listed, you may simply be breaking new ground. You can still use this typology to find adjacent models and adapt the mechanics that fit your context.

# **Purpose Pivot Venture Typology**

  

### **1. Software & AI**

### **2. Productized Services**

### **3. Consulting & Coaching**

### **4. Content, Education & Community**

### **5. Digital Goods & Commerce**

### **6. Local, Regenerative & Physical**

# 1. Software & AI

Indie software you can build and run with very low marginal cost. The goal is to ship a small, focused tool, own a specific workflow, and grow through recurring revenue or marketplace distribution. This category covers:

- **AI-first micro-SaaS / workflow copilots**
- **Vertical micro-SaaS (non-AI core)**
- **Minimal publishing tools**
- **Dev accelerators (boilerplates/starters)**
- **Solo APIs / data utilities**
- **Platform plug-ins & extensions (Shopify/Figma/Chrome)**
- **Agent actions & connectors (Model Context Protocol, MCP)**
- **LLM evaluation & monitoring micro-tools**
- **Desktop/menubar local-first AI**

In these models, AI is often the engine inside the product rather than the whole product. The defensibility comes from workflow design, smart integrations, and how the product handles data.

**Boundaries.** Hosted software belongs here. “Run-it-for-you” operations belong in *Productized Services*. Strategy and enablement work sits in *Consulting & Coaching*.

---

#### 1. AI-First Micro-SaaS / Workflow Copilots

**Description:** Focused tools where an LLM handles summarising, drafting, or reasoning within a simple interface. These tools integrate with a few key systems and aim to “do one job 10× faster” rather than become full platforms.

**Solo fit:** Small scope supports fast iteration, simple pricing, and direct user feedback. Many founders begin with a one-time licence and later add team plans or agent features.

**AI leverage:** Reasoning, retrieval, structured outputs, and tool use.

**Examples:**
- [TypingMind](https://www.typingmind.com/)
- [AI2SQL](https://www.starterstory.com/ai2sql)
- [Magai](https://magai.co/)

---

#### 2. Vertical Micro-SaaS (non-AI core)

**Description:** Minimalist utilities with a narrow promise—such as email tools, forms, or lightweight analytics—built around strong developer experience (DX).

**Solo fit:** Tiny codebases and well-defined scopes make direct support manageable. Growth often comes from word-of-mouth and public roadmaps.

**AI leverage:** Light support assistants, documentation, and small feature improvements.

**Examples:**
- [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/)
- [Tally](https://tally.so)
- [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/blog/bootstrapping-saas)

---

#### 3. Minimal Publishing Platforms

**Description:** Simple publishing tools that emphasise speed, privacy, and Markdown. Their purpose is to give writers a clean, long-term home for their content.

**Solo fit:** Easy for one person to maintain. When users value privacy and independence, churn stays low.

**AI leverage:** Light moderation, support, and documentation.

**Examples:**
- [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/)
- [Write.as](https://write.as/)

---

#### 4. Dev Accelerators (Boilerplates & Starter Kits)

**Description:** Production-ready starter repositories that include pieces like auth, billing, information architecture, and AI hooks. They help founders reduce time-to-market.

**Solo fit:** A blend of code, documentation, and changelogs becomes a repeatable product. Optional paid support provides an additional revenue stream.

**AI leverage:** Code scaffolding, documentation bots, snippet search.

**Examples:**
- [ShipFast](https://www.3minutesmarketing.co/p/the-1m-marketing-secret-of-shipfast)
- [Supastarter](https://supastarter.dev/)

---

#### 5. Solo APIs / Data Utilities

- [Sheety](https://sheety.co/)

---

#### 6. Platform Plug-ins & Extensions (Shopify / Figma / Browser)

**Description:** Small add-ons that extend major platforms and grow through their marketplaces. Monetisation can be one-time fees, seats, or tiered SaaS.

**Solo fit:** Focused niches and quick iteration keep support manageable within a single ecosystem.

**AI leverage:** In-plugin assistance, listing optimisation, support automation.

**Examples:**
- [Helium: Customer Fields (Shopify)](https://apps.shopify.com/customr)

---

#### 7. Agent Actions & Connectors (MCP Tools)

**Description:** Small servers or adapters that give AI agents safe, controlled actions—like accessing files, databases, or SaaS apps—using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

**Solo fit:** Each connector stays small and easy to support. Distribution usually happens through GitHub or marketplaces.

**AI leverage:** The connector itself provides the bridge that enables agentic behaviour.

**Examples:**

# 4. Content, Education & Community

Audience-first models where creator IP compounds over time. These ventures grow by publishing consistently, building trust with an audience, and layering in higher-value products and communities. AI helps compress the creative cycle so a solo creator or tiny team can run the publish → learn → product → community flywheel.

This category includes:
- **Creator-led content → app/community/ads/affiliate**
- **Newsletter → membership/community**
- **Book → courses/community**
- **Podcast → sponsorship/subscription**
- **Course → community**
- **Community-first membership**
- **Live sessions → replays pass**
- **Timed challenge → alumni community**

AI accelerates research, editing, clipping, summaries, personalisation, and moderation, making it easier for individuals to run audience-driven systems without a large production team.

Make-once/sell-many digital products that scale without ongoing production effort. This includes templates, creative assets, datasets, GPX packs, and small ecommerce catalogs powered by print-on-demand or dropshipping.
