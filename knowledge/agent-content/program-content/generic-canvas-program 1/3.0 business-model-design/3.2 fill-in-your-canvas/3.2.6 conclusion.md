**[MAIN PANEL: Completed Social Lean Canvas with all sections filled in]**

**Script (spoken):**

Great! You've filled in your Social Lean Canvas. That's an achievement worth acknowledging.

Most entrepreneurs never get, to this level of clarity. They are just running on faith and instinct hoping that their idea will just work if they build it. 

You've created a conceptual foundation—something you can test, improve, and evolve into a successful business model.


**[VISUAL TEXT: From scattered ideas → Coherent model]**

This is rare in the haphazard world of venture building. Well done!

**Tag line:** **Foundation complete.**

### What You Have Now

**[MAIN PANEL: Canvas sections highlighted]**

You have a clear sketch of your business model in one place. Your purpose, customer model, impact model, economic model and key metrics—all connected, all visible.

And you have a tool. You can take this canvas and talk it through with advisors, mentors, potential collaborators, other founders. Get their perspectives. Find out where your thinking might be off and discover gaps you hadn't seen.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Tool for conversation | Get perspectives | Find gaps]**

The canvas makes those conversations productive. Instead of vague ideas, you have something concrete to discuss and refine.

**Tag line:** **Ready for feedback.**

### You Built the Foundation

**[MAIN PANEL: Canvas as foundation, with space to build above it]**

You've built the foundation. The conceptual structure that everything else builds on.

Now you can build on it.

**Tag line:** **Foundation built.**

### **Next steps**

  

Having a completed canvas might be all you need for now.

- Your next moves might be obvious, and you can pull together a plan and start executing.
- Or you might have realised, through mapping things out, that this particular idea isn’t right – and that you’re better off tossing it and starting again. That can be a win too.
- Or you might be left with some big questions, like:
    - _How do I know if this business model is actually good?_
    - _If it has potential but isn’t good yet, how do I improve it?_
    - _What are the steps to take this business model and build it – to make it real in the world?_
    
If you’re holding questions like these, you should work through **Build**, our follow-on program -  where I’ll walk you through assessing your business model, making it stronger, and developing a strategy to build your venture.

Build does have a cost – that’s how we keep the program you’ve just completed **free and open to everyone**. But if you genuinely can’t afford to pay, just let us know and we’ll cover it. No one misses out because of money. People who can pay are paying it forward for those who can’t.

However you choose to proceed, well done. Completing your canvas is a big step towards building something that matters.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
Great work you've filled
in your social link canvas.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,767
This is an achievement
worth acknowledging.

3
00:00:05,027 --> 00:00:08,087
Most entrepreneurs never get
to this level of clarity.

4
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:12,257
They're just running on faith and
instinct and hoping that their idea

5
00:00:12,257 --> 00:00:13,787
will just work if they build it.

6
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:19,508
You've created a conceptual foundation,
something that you can test, improve, and

7
00:00:19,508 --> 00:00:22,088
evolve into a successful business model.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,510
This level of clarity is rare in the
haphazard world of venture building.

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:27,440
Well done

10
00:00:27,863 --> 00:00:31,613
you have a clear sketch of your
business model in one place, your

11
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:36,173
purpose, customer model, impact model,
economic model, and key metrics.

12
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,163
All connected and all visible.

13
00:00:38,527 --> 00:00:39,487
and you have a tool.

14
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:43,477
You can take this canvas and talk
it through with advisors, mentors,

15
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,517
potential collaborators and funders.

16
00:00:45,727 --> 00:00:49,207
Get their perspectives, find out
where your thinking might be off, and

17
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:51,187
discover gaps that you haven't seen yet.

18
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:55,559
The canvas makes those conversations
productive Instead of vague

19
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,829
ideas, you have something
concrete to discuss and refine.

20
00:00:59,647 --> 00:01:02,137
You've built the foundation,
the conceptual structure that

21
00:01:02,137 --> 00:01:03,457
everything else builds on.

22
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:04,897
Now you can build on it.

23
00:01:05,798 --> 00:01:08,828
Having completed your canvas might
be all that you need for now.

24
00:01:09,098 --> 00:01:10,838
Your next moves might be obvious.

25
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:13,975
You can pull together a
plan and start executing.

26
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:18,081
Or you might have realized through mapping
things out that this particular idea

27
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:22,011
isn't really good enough and that you're
better off tossing it and starting again.

28
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:23,329
This can be a win too.

29
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:28,135
Alternatively, you may be left with some
big questions like, how do I know if

30
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:29,935
it's actually good enough to work on?

31
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:34,545
and if it has potential but isn't good
yet, how do I improve it or what are the

32
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:38,625
steps I should take to actually execute
on this business model in the real world?

33
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:41,627
If you're holding questions like
these, you should work through.

34
00:01:41,627 --> 00:01:45,746
Build our follow on program where I'll
walk you through assessing your business

35
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:50,006
model, making it stronger, and developing
a strategy to build your venture.

36
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:51,799
Build does have a cost.

37
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:54,229
That's how we keep the
program you've just completed.

38
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,729
Free and open to everyone.

39
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:59,079
If you can't afford to pay, just
let us know and we'll cover it.

40
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:00,969
No one misses out because of money.

41
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:03,259
People who can pay are paying it forward.

42
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:06,421
For those who can't,  however
you choose to proceed.

43
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:07,051
Well done.

44
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:11,116
Completing your canvas is a big step
towards building something that matters.
