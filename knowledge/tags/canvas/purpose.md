Your purpose is the starting point for your canvas. It's your reason for creating this enterprise. It needs to be clearly defined in terms of the social or environmental problems that you want to solve.

So for the purpose section of the canvas, you need to craft a solid purpose statement. This purpose statement should be firstly inspirational to inspire you and others. It should be simple, clear and concise and easy to understand. It should be high level. This is not about describing the detail of exactly what you're going to do. It's a broad statement about your intentions. And finally, your purpose statement needs to be based around the fundamental social or environmental problem that you're trying to solve here.

So pull together these points and make a clear purpose statement that you can understand and that others will understand as well.
