<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
You're about to work through the Core content on improving your economic model. This is where you assess whether your economics are likely to actually work and how to strengthen them.

The Core Framework covers unit economics, breakeven analysis, growth assessment, and leverage types. Pay attention to the breakeven math and the leverage discussion - what makes business models powerful.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Unit economics | Breakeven | Growth | Leverage]**

After the Core content, we'll connect this to your customer model work and talk about what economic model improvement looks like at p2p scale.

**Tag line:** **Make the economics work.**

## P2P COMMENTARY

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Economic Model for PPVs"]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just walked you through improving your economic model. Unit economics, breakeven, growth potential, leverage types, strategic improvement levers.

Now let's talk about what this means for p2p Ventures.

**Tag line:** **P2P economic improvement.**

### From Customer Math to Economic Reality

**[MAIN PANEL: Connect Customer Model math to Economic Model]**

Back in the Customer Model section, we did the TAM times ARPU math. Remember the example? You need $100k income plus $20k costs equals $120k revenue.

Now let's make that concrete in economic model terms. How do you actually hit that number?

**[VISUAL TEXT: $120k revenue target | How to get there?]**

Work backwards from your revenue target.

If you need $120k in revenue and your gross margin is fifty percent - meaning half of every dollar goes to costs of goods sold - you actually need $240k in total revenue to net $120k after COGS.

Or you need to improve your gross margin. At eighty percent gross margin, you only need $150k total revenue to net $120k.

**[VISUAL TEXT: 50% margin = $240k needed | 80% margin = $150k needed]**

Then factor in your customer acquisition. If you need 1,000 customers at $150 each, and your conversion rate from visitor to customer is two percent, you need 50,000 visitors to your site, platform or shop.

Can your channels deliver that? How long will it take to build that traffic?

This is how you connect customer model assumptions to economic model reality. The math has to work all the way through.

**Tag line:** **Connect the math.**

### Channel Assessment at P2P Scale

**[MAIN PANEL: Channel types with cost indicators]**

The Core Framework showed you Pirate Metrics - Acquisition, Activation, Revenue, Retention, Referral. This helps you map customer flow and understand whether your channels can deliver the volume you need.

For p2p ventures, channel assessment matters even more because you probably can't afford expensive customer acquisition.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Limited acquisition budget | Need efficient channels]**

Organic-first channels typically work best. Content marketing where you build an audience over time. SEO where customers find you through search. AI discovery where customers find your to AI queries, Community where members bring other members. Word-of-mouth that compounds.

Leveraging platforms can be powerful - app stores, marketplaces, plugin directories. These platforms have built-in discovery. They contain customers who might already there looking for solutions like yours.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Content/SEO | Community | Platforms | Word-of-mouth]**

Calculate what customer acquisition cost your unit economics can support. Take your gross margin per customer and divide by three or four. That's roughly what you can afford to spend acquiring each customer and still be sustainable.

If your gross margin per customer is sixty dollars, you can probably afford fifteen to twenty dollars in CAC. If your planned acquisition channel costs fifty dollars per customer, your economics don't work.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Gross margin ÷ 3 or 4 = max affordable CAC]**

This constraint narrows your channel options significantly. But that's helpful. It focuses you on channels that actually work for your model.

**Tag line:** **Affordable acquisition.**

### Advantage and Leverage at Small Scale

**[MAIN PANEL: Leverage types diagram]**

Back when we filled in the Economic Model, we covered different leverage types. The Core Framework just went even deeper - the iPhone example, the Patagonia example, all the ways leverage multiplies value.

For p2p ventures, the question is: what leverage is actually accessible to you at small scale? The following forms of leverage are often good sources of advantage for ventures like yours:

**[VISUAL TEXT: What leverage works small?]**

**Product leverage** works well. Courses instead of one-on-one coaching. Templates instead of custom work. SaaS instead of services. You build once, sell many times. This is classic product leverage - pulling together value creation into a scalable product.

**Technology leverage** through platforms is hugely accessible. Stripe handles payments. Substack manages subscribers. Shopify runs e-commerce infrastructure. You leverage their technology without having to build it yourself.

**Network leverage** can work at small scale. Members recruit other members. They create content. They provide support to each other. The community becomes self-reinforcing. Even modest network effects can create meaningful leverage.

**Perceptual leverage** through personal brand is naturally solo-friendly. Your unique voice, your specific expertise, your authentic perspective. This form of perceptual leverage can't be replicated and doesn't require scale to be effective.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Product | Technology | Network | Perceptual]**

Some forms of leverage typically require more resources. **Capital leverage** needs significant funds to invest. **Strategic leverage** often requires market position and influence. It's worth understanding which types of leverage are realistically available to you.

**Tag line:** **Accessible leverage.**

### P2P Constraints and Focus

**[MAIN PANEL: Constraint framework diagram]**

We've already talked about channels - direct sales teams and high-touch enterprise sales typically don't work solo. But there are other constraints worth thinking through.

These aren't absolute rules. There might be ways to make these work for your specific model. But for most P2P ventures, these patterns create challenges.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Common challenges for PPVs]**

**Subsidizing growth** is probably difficult. Without VC funding or other significant capital, you likely need positive unit economics from early on. You can't burn money acquiring customers while you figure out monetization later on.

**Long sales cycles** are probably challenging. If deals take six months to close and require constant nurturing, that's hard to manage solo while also building product and serving existing customers.

**High-touch onboarding** might not scale. If every new customer requires hours of your time to get started, you hit capacity quickly. Self-service or automated onboarding probably works better.

**High churn** is probably unsustainable. If you're losing customers as fast as you acquire them, and acquisition is expensive for you, the economics probably won't work. Strong retention becomes critical.

**High physical footprint** is probably unaffordable. Funding and maintaining your own premises, production facilities or event spaces is probably out of reach.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Positive unit economics early | Self-serve onboarding | Strong retention needed]**

These constraints can actually help. They narrow your options and focus you on economic models that are more likely to work at your scale.

**Tag line:** **Constraints focus.**

### Two Primary Levers: ARPU and Costs

**[MAIN PANEL: ARPU increase and Cost reduction levers]**

At p2p scale, you have two primary levers for improving your economic model.

First, **increase ARPU** - Annual Revenue Per User. Get more money from each customer. You can try:
- Premium positioning. Charge more by serving a segment that values what you do and has ability to pay.
- Bundling. Combine products or services to increase transaction value.
- Move upmarket. Serve customers who have bigger budgets and pay higher prices.
- Annual vs monthly pricing. Get customers to commit for a year instead of month-to-month or event by event. This improves both cash flow and retention.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Premium positioning | Bundling | Upmarket | Annual pricing]**

Flip the math and work on the revenue model backwards - If you need 1,000 customers at $120 per year to hit your target, doubling ARPU to $240 means you only need 500 customers. Half the acquisition required. How might this work? 


Second lever: **reduce costs.** Lower your cost of goods sold or your fixed costs. You can try:
- Automate non-core work. Use AI for customer support, content creation, data analysis - tasks that don't require your direct expertise.
- Platform versus custom build. Use existing platforms instead of building everything yourself. Much lower costs.
- Outsource strategically. Contractors for specialized work you need occasionally, not full-time staff.
- Partner to access physical spaces and equipment without needing to acquire your own

**[VISUAL TEXT: Automate with AI | Use platforms | Strategic contractors]**

Flip the math and work backwards for this too. If your COGS is eighty dollars per customer and you reduce it to sixty dollars, your gross margin per customer increases by twenty dollars. Multiply that by 1,000 customers - that's $20k more profit. How might you achieve this?

Both levers are powerful. And sometimes you can pull both simultaneously.

**Tag line:** **Two levers, big impact.**

### Use AI for Economic Research

**[MAIN PANEL: Research workflow diagram]**

Throughout the improvement process, use AI tools to accelerate your research and analysis.

Research pricing in your industry and category. What do similar products or services charge? What's the range? Where could you position?

Find unit economics benchmarks for similar business models. What gross margins are typical? What CAC is normal? This helps you assess whether your numbers are realistic.

Analyze competitor pricing and positioning. How do they structure their offers? What value propositions support their pricing?

**[VISUAL TEXT: Pricing research | Unit economics benchmarks | Competitor analysis]**

Identify cost reduction opportunities. What could be automated in your model? Where could AI replace manual work? What platforms could you use instead of custom building?

Research channel effectiveness. Which acquisition channels work well for ventures similar to yours? What conversion rates are realistic? What does CAC look like for different channels?

Generate ideas for ARPU improvement or cost reduction. AI is good at pattern matching across industries and suggesting approaches you might not have considered.

This research accelerates the improvement work significantly. You're not guessing. You're making informed decisions based on what's working elsewhere.

**Tag line:** **Research accelerates improvement.**

### Your Turn

**[MAIN PANEL: Economic Model section on blank canvas]**

Now apply this to your own economic model. 

Follow the instructions from the core content and document the assumptions you are making these will flow into the validation process. But keep in mind how you are different as a p2p ventures and what the particular needs of your business model are.
