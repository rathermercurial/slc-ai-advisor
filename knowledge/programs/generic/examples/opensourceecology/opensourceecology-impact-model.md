## Impact Chain

### Issue
Artificial material scarcity from proprietary technology systems that concentrate productive power and limit community access to essential tools.

### Participants
Global network of farmers, engineers, builders, students, communities, foundations, entrepreneurs, and institutions collaborating on open source technology development.

### Activities
Collaborative development of open source industrial machines, intensive education programs, community building, and distributed production with comprehensive documentation sharing.

### Short-Term Outcomes
Increased access to affordable machinery, practical skills development, reduced external dependency, comprehensive knowledge documentation.

### Medium-Term Outcomes
Networks of competent practitioners, regional manufacturing capabilities, multiplied impact through education, sustainable local businesses creation.

### Long-Term Outcomes
Distributed manufacturing adoption, technological sovereignty achievement, innovation acceleration through open collaboration, fundamental community-technology relationship transformation.

### Impact
Post-scarcity world eliminating resource conflicts through distributed productive capacity, enabling human prosperity without dependency on extractive systems.

Please note, this impact model has been compiled from publicly available data. It is a best estimate of this organization's impact model but information may be out of date and/or could differ from the organization's own description of their impact model.

## Visual Representation Instructions
For creating visual impact model:
1. Display as a flow from Issue → Impact
2. Each element should connect to the next in the chain
3. Use arrows or connectors to show causality
4. Keep each statement to one clear sentence
