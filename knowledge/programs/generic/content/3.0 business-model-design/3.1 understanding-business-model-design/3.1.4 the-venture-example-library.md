### Learning from Real Ventures

Understanding business model design in theory is one thing. Seeing it work in practice is another.

Throughout this program, you have access to the Venture Example Library - a collection of real purpose-driven ventures that have built successful, impactful business models.

`[MAIN PANEL: Example library interface showing grid of venture cards]`

Each example gives you three things: an outline of how the venture works, a complete walkthrough of their Social Lean Canvas showing how their customer, impact, and economic models work together, and a detailed look at their impact model.

You can access these examples anytime throughout the program. Use them to see how different organizations applied the tools and techniques we're covering. You'll see patterns in how ventures design their business models. You'll see different approaches to creating and capturing value. And you'll learn from the choices and trade-offs they made along the way.

We'll reference specific examples throughout the program when they illustrate a particular concept. But don't wait for us - explore them on your own... see what resonates. See what surprises you.

The library is there to support your learning, whenever you need it.

### You're Ready

These core principles will help you make sense of your journey through the Social Lean Canvas. The journey from an early model full of untested assumptions and risks, to a validated, repeatable, scalable business model.
