## INTRODUCTION

p2p 5.1 introduction.webm

**[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas - full view]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
Now you've done a bunch of hard work. You've assessed your customer model, your impact model, and your economic model. You've identified weaknesses and strengthened them. You've moved beyond back-of-napkin thinking.

You now have one or more business models that are good enough to test.

So what's next?

Now you need strategy. You need to turn your business model into action.

**Tag line:** **From model to action.**

### Why Strategy Matters

**[MAIN PANEL: Multiple paths branching from current position]**

Strategy is what directs your time, effort, and money into the most important and valuable activities.

Missing on strategy is just as bad as missing on business model design. Both result in failure.

There are a million ways to burn time, money, and effort going in the wrong direction and getting nowhere. Threading a path for your venture through all the potential missteps - that's the job of good, strategy.

**Tag line:** **Direction matters.**

## Strategy as a living process

It is also important for strategy to not be seen as a fixed thing. So often businesses end up executing on old strategies that haven't reflected the reality of the business for months or years.

It is doubly important when you are starting out, that your strategy be a flexible and evolving process. 

Because you will be constantly evolving your business model as you validate it, you will need to constantly evolve your strategy as well. 

Developing your strategy can't be about creating a giant document that everyone will blindly follow. It needs to be a flexible and evolving process that at any point in time captures your best path forward in your current reality. 

The strategy model is designed to be a living document that you constantly update as you learn and iterate your business model.

### The Validation Journey

**[MAIN PANEL: Build-Measure-Learn cycle diagram]**

You'll recall from the module on business model design that the journey from untested business model idea to successful venture is one of validation and iteration. Taking the untested assumptions in your business model, testing them, and then evolving the business model as you learn.

This journey is what your strategy will map. It will make sure you're taking sensible next steps and not wasting your time and money on the wrong activities.

**Tag line:** **Test, learn, evolve.**

### What This Module Covers

**[MAIN PANEL: Three-step journey visual]**

This module takes you from untested business model to executable strategy. Three sections, three critical outputs.

**Section 5.2: Assessing Your Stage**

Firstly assessing your stage - The output of this is an understanding of where you are now across customer, impact, economic, and organizational dimensions.

You can't plan forward without knowing your starting point. This section gives you a clear assessment of your current stage so you can build a strategy that matches your reality.

**Section 5.3-5.6: Validation**

Secondly planning how to validate your business model. They output of this is validation plans for each of your customer, impact, and economic model models.

These plans specify exactly what assumptions you're testing, what experiments you'll run,  what success looks like, and what timeline and resources you need. 

**Section 5.7: Building Your Strategy Model**

And finally building your strategy model. The output of this is a complete multilayer strategy covering your business model development journey, organizational development, and capital strategy.

This integrates everything - your validation experiments, what organizational capacity you need and when and where capital enters to enable your plans. This is your clear but flexible roadmap from where you are now to validated, sustainable venture.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Know your stage | Plan validation | Build complete strategy]**

This is essential work. Without stage assessment, you're guessing where to start. Without validation plans, you're just hoping your assumptions are right. Without integrated strategy, you're reacting rather than executing deliberately.

With these outputs, you have a roadmap. Clear enough to execute. Flexible enough to adapt and evolve as you learn.

As with the previous modules, each section introduces Core Framework content that applies to all ventures, then reconnects with guidance specific to P2P ventures like yours - how to approach this work when you're solo or small team, building with limited resources.

**Tag line:** **Build your roadmap.**
