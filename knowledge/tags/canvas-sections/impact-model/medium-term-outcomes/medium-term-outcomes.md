# medium-term-outcomes

## Definition
The `medium-term-outcomes` tag identifies content about intermediate changes that build from short-term outcomes - typically occurring within 1-3 years and representing sustained behavioral or systemic changes.

## Usage Criteria

- Discusses sustained change assessment

- Analyzes outcome progression and chain analysis

## Always Include When
- Content focuses on sustained change measurement
- Intermediate outcome tracking methodologies
- Medium-term impact assessment approaches
- Outcome progression analysis

## Never Include When
- Short or long-term outcome content (use specific outcome tags)
- Immediate results content (use `short-term-outcomes`)
- Ultimate impact content (use `impact`)

## Required Combinations
- Must include appropriate canvas-sections hierarchy: [impact-model, medium-term-outcomes]

## Content Examples
- Medium-term outcome measurement frameworks
- Intermediate impact assessment methodologies
- Outcome progression analysis approaches
- Medium-term evaluation strategies
