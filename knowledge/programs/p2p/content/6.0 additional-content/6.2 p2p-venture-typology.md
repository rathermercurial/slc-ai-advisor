# **Purpose Pivot Venture Typology (P2P)**

  


Welcome! This is the Purpose Pivot Venture Typology — a practical map of the small, sustainable venture types that solo founders and tiny teams use today. It helps you understand the main approaches available, see real examples of each type, and spark ideas for how your own venture could work or evolve.

  

This list is not exhaustive. Founders are endlessly creative, and AI continues to change what’s possible. New variations appear all the time — sometimes even completely new categories. If your idea isn’t listed, you may simply be breaking new ground. You can still use this typology to find adjacent models and adapt the mechanics that fit your context.

# 1. Software & AI

Indie software you can build and run with very low marginal cost. The goal is to ship a small, focused tool, own a specific workflow, and grow through recurring revenue or marketplace distribution. This category covers:

- **AI-first micro-SaaS / workflow copilots**
- **Vertical micro-SaaS (non-AI core)**
- **Minimal publishing tools**
- **Dev accelerators (boilerplates/starters)**
- **Solo APIs / data utilities**
- **Platform plug-ins & extensions (Shopify/Figma/Chrome)**
- **Agent actions & connectors (Model Context Protocol, MCP)**
- **LLM evaluation & monitoring micro-tools**
- **Desktop/menubar local-first AI**

In these models, AI is often the engine inside the product rather than the whole product. The defensibility comes from workflow design, smart integrations, and how the product handles data.

**Boundaries.** Hosted software belongs here. “Run-it-for-you” operations belong in *Productized Services*. Strategy and enablement work sits in *Consulting & Coaching*.

---

#### 1. AI-First Micro-SaaS / Workflow Copilots

**Description:** Focused tools where an LLM handles summarising, drafting, or reasoning within a simple interface. These tools integrate with a few key systems and aim to “do one job 10× faster” rather than become full platforms.

**Solo fit:** Small scope supports fast iteration, simple pricing, and direct user feedback. Many founders begin with a one-time licence and later add team plans or agent features.

**AI leverage:** Reasoning, retrieval, structured outputs, and tool use.

**Examples:**
- [TypingMind](https://www.typingmind.com/)
- [AI2SQL](https://www.starterstory.com/ai2sql)
- [Magai](https://magai.co/)

---

#### 2. Vertical Micro-SaaS (non-AI core)

**Description:** Minimalist utilities with a narrow promise—such as email tools, forms, or lightweight analytics—built around strong developer experience (DX).

**Solo fit:** Tiny codebases and well-defined scopes make direct support manageable. Growth often comes from word-of-mouth and public roadmaps.

**AI leverage:** Light support assistants, documentation, and small feature improvements.

**Examples:**
- [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/)
- [Tally](https://tally.so)
- [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/blog/bootstrapping-saas)

## **Content, Education & Community**

  

Audience-first, approach-based models where **creator IP compounds over time**. Core approaches: **Creator-led content → app/community/ads/affiliate**, **Newsletter → membership/community**, **Book → courses/community**, and **Podcast → sponsorship/subscription**. Complementary approaches: **Course → community**, **Community-first membership**, **Live sessions → replays pass**, and **Timed challenge → alumni community**. Delivery mechanics (cohorts, pods, workshops, lifetime access) are interchangeable add-ons to any approach.

  

AI accelerates research, editing, clips/summaries, personalization, and moderation so a solo or tiny team can run the **publish → learn → product → community** flywheel.

  

**Boundaries.** Hosted tools/platforms belong in _Software & AI_. Advisory/implementation work goes to _Consulting & Coaching_. “Done-for-you” recurring ops (running someone’s community, editing their podcast, localization) live in _Productized Services_. Pure downloadables (templates, assets, datasets) are in _Digital Goods & Commerce_.

1. **Creator-Led Content → App/Community/Ads/Affiliate**
    
    - **Description:** Grow an audience on YouTube or social platforms, then monetize via a branded app/portal, memberships/community, sponsorships/ads, and selective affiliate offers.

# Purpose Pivot Venture Typology

### 1. Software & AI
### 2. Productized Services
### 3. Consulting & Coaching
### 4. Content, Education & Community
### 5. Digital Goods and Commerce
### 6. Local, Regenerative & Physical 



## **Software & AI**

Indie software you can build and run with near-zero marginal cost—ship a tiny tool, own a razor-thin workflow, and compound via recurring revenue or marketplace distribution. Core lanes: **AI-first micro-SaaS / workflow copilots**, **vertical micro-SaaS (non-AI core)**, **minimal publishing tools**, **dev accelerators (boilerplates/starters)**, **solo APIs/data utilities**, plus 2024–25-native surfaces: **platform plug-ins & extensions (Shopify/Figma/Chrome)**, **agent actions & connectors (MCP tools)**, **LLM eval & monitoring microtools**, and **desktop/menubar local-first AI**. AI is the engine—not the product—while your moat comes from workflow design, integrations, and data handling. 

**Boundaries:** hosted software lives here; “run-it-for-you” ops belong in _Productized Services_; strategy/enablement sits in _Consulting & Coaching_.

1. **AI-First Micro-SaaS / Workflow Copilots**
    - **What it is:** Focused tools where an LLM is the core engine (summarize, draft, reason) wrapped in a clean UI and a few high-value integrations. Think “do one job 10× faster,” not a platform.
    - **Solo fit:** Small surface area → quick shipping, direct user feedback, transparent pricing; can start one-time and evolve to teams/agents.
    - **AI leverage:** Reasoning, retrieval, structured output, tool-use.
    - **Examples:** [TypingMind](https://www.typingmind.com/) — solo-started, crossed **$1M in 20 months** and now ships teams/agents. [AI2SQL](https://www.starterstory.com/ai2sql) – natural-language → SQL; solo indie case study. [Magai](https://magai.co/) – multi-model chat workspace; solo/tiny-team wrapper).

2. **Vertical Micro-SaaS (non-AI core)**
    - **What it is:** Opinionated, minimalist utilities (email, forms, analytics) with a narrow promise and solid DX.
    - **Solo fit:** Tiny codebases + hands-on support; calm growth via word-of-mouth and public roadmaps.
    - **AI leverage:** Support co-pilots, docs, modest feature assist.
    - **Examples:** [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/) (indie newsletter tool)  / [Tally](https://tally.so) (bootstrapped forms, scaled to meaningful MRR). [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/blog/bootstrapping-saas) (privacy-first analytics; bootstrapped growth)

3. **Minimal Publishing Platforms**
    - **What it is:** No-bloat tools for writing/publishing (privacy, speed, Markdown). The pitch is “your words, online — forever.”
    - **Solo fit:** Single maintainer + loyal niche community; low churn when values align (privacy/independence).
    - **AI leverage:** Light moderation, docs, and support.
    - **Examples:** [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/) (privacy-first blogging)  / [Write.as](https://write.as/) (minimal blog; open-source sibling WriteFreely). 

4. **Dev Accelerators (Boilerplates & Starter Kits)**
    - **What it is:** Paid, production-ready starter repos (auth, billing, IA, AI hooks) that sell time-to-market.
    - **Solo fit:** Code + docs + changelog; upsell support hours; durable long-tail.
    - **AI leverage:** Codegen scaffolds, doc bots, snippet search.
    - **Examples:** [ShipFast](https://www.3minutesmarketing.co/p/the-1m-marketing-secret-of-shipfast) (Next.js boilerplate with six-figure run-rate)  / [Supastarter](https://supastarter.dev/) (Next.js/Nuxt/SvelteKit kit; indie-run, multi-stack). 

5. **Solo APIs / Data Utilities**
    - **What it is:** “Plumbing” services that expose data/actions via simple endpoints (sheets→API, wrappers, enrichers).
    - **Solo fit:** Low infra, dev-to-dev sales, sticky once integrated.
    - **AI leverage:** Data cleanup, embeddings, support bots.
    - **Examples:** [NoCodeAPI (HN founder story)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34520664)  / [Sheety](https://sheety.co/) (Google Sheets → REST API). 
    
6. **Platform Plug-ins & Extensions (Shopify / Figma / Browser)**
    - **What it is:** Small, installable add-ons that ride big distribution (app stores/marketplaces). Monetize via one-time, seat, or tiered SaaS.
    - **Solo fit:** Tight niche + platform SEO + fast iteration; customer support is scoped to one host platform.
    - **AI leverage:** In-plugin assistance, listing optimization, support.
    - **Examples:** Shopify — [Helium “Customer Fields”](https://apps.shopify.com/customr) + case study (ads → **764%** revenue growth).   / [Figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042786733-Create-a-plugin-for-development?utm_source=chatgpt.com) — official plugin docs (solo-friendly dev loop): [Create a plugin](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042786733-Create-a-plugin-for-development).  / Browser — solo-built Chrome extensions earning meaningful MRR [first-person stories](https://www.rickblyth.com/blog/how-much-money-i-made-developing-chrome-extensions?utm_source=chatgpt.com). 

7. **Agent Actions & Connectors (MCP Tools)**
    - **What it is:** Little servers and adapters that give agents safe actions (files, DBs, SaaS) using the **Model Context Protocol**; sold as paid tools/templates.
    - **Solo fit:** Small scope per connector; dev-to-dev distribution (GitHub, marketplaces) with support via issues/Discord.
    - **AI leverage:** The product _is_ the bridge for agentic AI.
    - **Examples:** MCP — official site/spec: [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://www.modelcontextprotocol.io/)  / [Awesome MCP Servers](https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-mcp-servers) (curated list of servers like Git, Google Drive, Stripe, etc.).

8. **LLM Eval & Monitoring Microtools**
    - **What it is:** Narrow utilities for prompt testing, guardrails, red-team checks, traces/metrics. Think “make AI outputs safer/more reliable.”
    - **Solo fit:** Tiny binaries/CLIs/SaaS with usage-based or indie pricing; land with dev teams through docs and examples.
    - **AI leverage:** Self-play test generation, auto-red-teaming.
    - **Examples:** [promptfoo](https://github.com/varun86/PromptFoo) (prompt eval CLI)  / [Langfuse](https://blog.octabyte.io/posts/applications/langfuse/langfuse-open-source-llm-engineering-platform-for-observability-metrics-prompt-management/) (open-source observability)  / [Guardrails](https://www.guardrailsai.com/docs) (validation/structured outputs). 

9. **Desktop & Menubar Utilities (Local-First AI)**
    - **What it is:** Lightweight Mac/Win apps that run Whisper/LLMs locally (privacy, speed, offline). Monetize via one-time or modest licenses.
    - **Solo fit:** Great for indie macOS/Windows devs; support is predictable; no server bills.
    - **AI leverage:** On-device ASR, local LLMs via Ollama/MLX.
    - **Examples:** [MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper) (indie, local transcription; App Store listing available)   / [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) (desktop UI for local models)  / [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) (local LLM runner across OSes).

## **Content, Education & Community**

Audience-first, approach-based models where creator IP compounds over time. Core approaches: **Creator-led content, **Newsletters**, **Book-Led, and **Podcast-Led**. Complementary approaches: **Course → community**, **Community-first membership**, **Live sessions**, and **Timed challenge**. Delivery mechanics (cohorts, pods, workshops, lifetime access) are interchangeable add-ons to any approach. 

AI accelerates research, editing, clips/summaries, personalization, and moderation so a solo or tiny team can run the publish → learn → product → community flywheel.

**Boundaries:** Hosted tools/platforms belong in _Software & AI_; advisory/implementation work goes to _Consulting & Coaching_; “done-for-you” recurring ops (running someone’s community, editing their podcast, localization) live in _Productized Services_; pure downloadables (templates, assets, datasets) are in _Digital Goods & Commerce_
