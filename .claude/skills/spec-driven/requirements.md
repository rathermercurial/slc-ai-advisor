# Requirements Phase

Define WHAT to build before deciding how.

## Questions to Answer

- **Problem:** What problem does this solve? What's the cost of not building it?
- **Users:** Who benefits? What do they do today without this feature?
- **Success:** How do we know it works? Write as testable statements.
- **Scope:** What's explicitly OUT of scope?
- **Constraints:** Timeline, technical limitations, dependencies?
- **Open questions:** Anything that needs answering before design?

## Gate

Ask user: *"Does this capture what you want? Any changes before I move to design?"*
