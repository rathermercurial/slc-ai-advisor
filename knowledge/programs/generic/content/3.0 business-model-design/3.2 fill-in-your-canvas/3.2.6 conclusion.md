**[MAIN PANEL: Completed Social Lean Canvas with all sections filled in]**

**Script (spoken):**

Great! You've filled in your Social Lean Canvas. That's an achievement worth acknowledging.

Most entrepreneurs never get, to this level of clarity. They are just running on faith and instinct hoping that their idea will just work if they build it. 

You've created a conceptual foundation—something you can test, improve, and evolve into a successful business model.


**[VISUAL TEXT: From scattered ideas → Coherent model]**

This is rare in the haphazard world of venture building. Well done!

**Tag line:** **Foundation complete.**

### What You Have Now

**[MAIN PANEL: Canvas sections highlighted]**

You have a clear sketch of your business model in one place. Your purpose, customer model, impact model, economic model and key metrics—all connected, all visible.

And you have a tool. You can take this canvas and talk it through with advisors, mentors, potential collaborators, other founders. Get their perspectives. Find out where your thinking might be off and discover gaps you hadn't seen.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Tool for conversation | Get perspectives | Find gaps]**

The canvas makes those conversations productive. Instead of vague ideas, you have something concrete to discuss and refine.

**Tag line:** **Ready for feedback.**

### You Built the Foundation

**[MAIN PANEL: Canvas as foundation, with space to build above it]**

You've built the foundation. The conceptual structure that everything else builds on.

Now you can build on it.

**Tag line:** **Foundation built.**

### **Next steps**

  

Having a completed canvas might be all you need for now.

- Your next moves might be obvious, and you can pull together a plan and start executing.
- Or you might have realised, through mapping things out, that this particular idea isn’t right – and that you’re better off tossing it and starting again. That can be a win too.
- Or you might be left with some big questions, like:
    - _How do I know if this business model is actually good?_
    - _If it has potential but isn’t good yet, how do I improve it?_
    - _What are the steps to take this business model and build it – to make it real in the world?_
    
If you’re holding questions like these, you should work through **Build**, our follow-on program -  where I’ll walk you through assessing your business model, making it stronger, and developing a strategy to build your venture.

Build does have a cost – that’s how we keep the program you’ve just completed **free and open to everyone**. But if you genuinely can’t afford to pay, just let us know and we’ll cover it. No one misses out because of money. People who can pay are paying it forward for those who can’t.

However you choose to proceed, well done. Completing your canvas is a big step towards building something that matters.
