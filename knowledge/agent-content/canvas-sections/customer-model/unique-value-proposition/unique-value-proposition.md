# Unique Value Proposition

## Definition

**Unique Value Proposition (UVP)** describes the benefits that your customers will get from using your product or service. A UVP is based on the particular job that your customer is trying to get done and the special way that you are going to do this job for them.

This is not the same as your solution (which describes your product or service). The UVP focuses on describing the **benefit** that your customer will experience from using your product or service.

## Core Principles

### Benefits, Not Features

- Focus on what customers will gain, not what your product does
- Describe the outcome or result they'll experience
- Connect directly to the customer's motivations and needs from the jobs to be done
- As with JTBD, one or more UVPs per customer type

### Demonstrate Deep Customer Understanding

- The UVP section is where you prove you deeply understand your customers
- Show you understand what they're trying to achieve
- Demonstrate you know what value they're seeking
- Prove you know how to talk to them about it. Could you imagine a customer saying the value proposition when they describe your product/service

### One UVP Per Customer Type

- If you have multiple customer types, you need different UVPs for each
- Each UVP should correspond to a different job to be done
- Color code or number them to match your customer types
- Different customer segments of the same customer type will share similar UVPs

### Address the "Why Choose You" Question

- Articulate the particular benefit you can deliver that others can't
- Show why customers would choose you over existing alternatives
- Highlight what makes your approach special or different

## Why Unique Value Propositions Matter

### Foundation for Customer Engagement

Your UVP is the bridge between understanding customer needs and communicating your solution. It translates the job to be done into language that resonates with customers and motivates them to engage with your offering. 

### Competitive Differentiation

A strong UVP positions you distinctly in the market by highlighting benefits that alternatives can't easily provide. It's not just about being different - it's about being meaningfully better for specific customer needs, in a way that is very specific to their actual needs

### Marketing and Communication Foundation

Your UVP becomes the core message for all customer communications. It guides how you talk about your offering across all channels and touchpoints.

### Business Model Validation

A compelling UVP that customers respond to indicates you're solving a real problem in a way that creates genuine value - evidence of [job-solution-fit](../../../../lexicon-entry/job-solution-fit.md) potential.

## Implementation Approach

1. **Customer Model** - Your UVP should directly address the specific jobs customers are hiring you to do. This flows through the customer model from customers, jobs to be done and then UVP
2. **Build on JTBD** - follow the development of your jobs to be done to figure our the UVP  
3. **Discover what is unique about what you offer** - What can you do differently or better?
4. **Articulate the Benefit** - What positive outcome will they experience?
5. **Test Your Language** - Does this resonate with actual customers?
6. **Connect to Emotions** - What will they feel as a result of this benefit?
7. **Validate with real customers** - progressively validate your UVP more deeply as your venture progresses

## Common Pitfalls

- **Feature Focus**: Describing what your product does vs what customers will experience
- **Generic Benefits**: Value propositions that could apply to any competitor
- **Internal Language**: Using company jargon instead of customer language
- **One-Size-Fits-All**: Same UVP for different customer types with different needs
- **No Differentiation**: Benefits that don't distinguish you from alternatives

## Examples 

**[Age Co](../../../venture-example-libraries/core-venture-example-library/age-co-uk/age-co-uk-slc.md):**
- **Older Customers**: "Trusted support and peace of mind from products designed specifically for later life"
- **Family Members**: "Confidence that your loved ones are getting quality care and expert guidance"
- Both get the added benefit: "Every purchase helps support other older people in need"

**[Auticon](../../../venture-example-libraries/core-venture-example-library/auticon/auticon-slc.md):**
- **Corporate Clients**: "Superior technical results and a pathway to becoming more neuroinclusive"
- **Autistic Consultants**: "Sustainable tech career where you're valued for your authentic self and talents"

**[Toast Ale](../../../venture-example-libraries/core-venture-example-library/toast-ale/toast-ale-slc.md):**
- **Consumers**: "Premium craft beer that turns every sip into environmental action"
- **Retail Partners**: "Differentiated products with built-in sustainability story that attracts conscious consumers"
