# Impact model

### Overview  
ImpactModel.Overview 

1. Just as your customer model describes how you create customer value, your impact model shows how you create social value
    
2. It shows how your activities are going to generate positive social or environmental outcomes that will then create long-term impact
    
3. Based on what you have described in your purpose section, your impact model will show the chain of causality, the logic by which your intentions will translate into impact that will actually occur in the world
    
4. This gets you beyond mere hopes and assumptions about the positive change you are going to cause, and gets real about how this will actually happen.
    


ImpactModel.Overview.Context

  

5. Depending on what you are trying to achieve, your impact model will be more or less complicated
    
6. This template will allow you to sketch out each component of your impact model as a simple starting point for you to build on
    
7. This is just one template for developing an impact model. There are many others. Feel free to use a different one if you know it better, or it is one used by your organisation, funder or a programme you are in.  
    
8. If your impact model is pretty simple, you may just have a single line that maps you impact from issue through to final impact. But if it is more complex, then you may have several, and they may interact in complex ways.
    
9. If this is the case it is going to take a bit more time and effort to develop your impact model
    
10. That said, also make sure that you aren't making your impact model more complex than it needs to be. It can be tempting to add in every positive thing that your business could do. But keep it simple by focusing only on the impact components that truely align with your purpose.
    

  

### Disclaimer  

ImpactModel.Overview.Disclaimer

  

1. This impact logic you are creating here tells the story of how the things you do will address real issues for real people in a predictable and measurable way. But of course there are often many more factors causing these issues than you could hope to address on your own
    
2. Complex problems cannot be solved with one simple fix.
    
3. So your impact model needs to reflect that you understand the system that is producing the issue that you want to solve and that, based on this understanding,  your intervention (often in conjunction with other's work) will influence the system in a significant and positive way.
    

### Issue  
ImpactModel.Issue

1. The Issue section of your impact model draws directly from your Purpose statement. This issue is the thing you are really trying to address with your enterprise, the problem you are trying to solve.
    
2. For this first pass through the canvas, describe the Issue in a high-level way.
    
3. But even though you are only going to describe simply here in the canvas, you do need to understand it deeply, or be on the journey to understanding it deeply, otherwise you can't hope to do anything genuinely useful about it.
    

### Participants  
ImpactModel.Participants

  

1. The participants in your impact model are your stakeholders, the people or organisations, who will participate in your impact activities.
    
2. This will include any core beneficiary groups that you are serving as well as other key people and organisations who will engage with you on your impact activities
    
3. A participant might also be a customer in your customer model if they play a key role in making your broader business model work
    

### Activities  
ImpactModel.Activities

1. Your Activities are the things that your participants will do because of your enterprise.
    
2. They will ultimately lead to the impact that you want to have
    
3. Activities could be for example... a participant group - attends a training programme you offer, installs solar lighting, plants trees, receives medical treatment, things like that.
    
4. It'll be different for every impact model, but the activities need to be the things that ultimately cause the impact to happen
    
5. These Impact activities will also be outlined as part of your solution in the solution section of your customer model.
    
6.   
    

7. >>>>This would be the case if say you were selling low cost solar lighting to low income families. The families would be a customer in the customer model as well as a participant in the impact model. The key difference here is that in the customer model you are trying to show that they (as the customer) will pay for the solar lighting, to prove that your business model can generate income, and in the impact model you are mapping the positive outcomes that will result from them buying and actually using the lighting.
    
8. >>>>For the customer model buying the lighting is enough, but in the impact model you need to be able to show that they use it and that measurable positive change will result over time
    

### Short-term outcomes  
ImpactModel.ShortTermOutcomes

1. Following from the activities you need to map out the short-term outcomes that will flow from them.
    
2. These are positive outcomes that will result immediately from your activities and be the first small step towards the impact that you are trying to have
    

### Medium-term outcomes  
ImpactModel.MediumTermOutcomes

1. Medium-term outcomes are the positive changes that will follow on from your short-term outcomes. They are the measurable changes that are going to occur over the next say, 1-2 years, as a direct result of your short-term outcomes
    

### Long-term outcomes  
ImpactModel.LongTermOutcomes

1. Your long-term outcomes are the long-term positive changes that will follow your short and medium-term outcomes
    
2. Perhaps across a 2-10 year time horizon
    

### Impact  
ImpactModel.Impact

1. The final Impact section of your impact model describes what the state of the world will be like when you have achieved your purpose
    
2. It is the destination of your activities and you short, medium and long term outcomes.
    
3. It should be simple, short and high-level. It's okay for this to be a bit abstract. The detail you capture in your outcomes make it concrete. 
    
4. It is describing the world after all of the steps of your impact model have been delivered on.
    

  

## Example - educational mentoring service -  
ImpactModel.Example.Intro

1. Let's walk through an example to help understand how to fill in your impact model
    
2. Imagine an enterprise that delivers its impact through providing mentoring programmes for kids who are getting kicked out of school for behavioural issues
    
3. This is a fake enterprise just for the sake of understanding the process
    

  

### Issue  
    ImpactModel.Example.Issue
    

The issue would relate to the enterprise's purpose statement. The issue might be something like "young people are falling out of school because they aren't getting the support they need to overcome solvable problems. This is creating long-term issues around lack of employment, lack of self-esteem and other social issues affecting them, their families and the wider community”

  

### Participants  
    ImpactModel.Example.Participants
    

Participants will be the various key stakeholders that they need to work together in the impact model. for example

1. Firstly Students - say... "students between the ages of 14-17, at schools in low income communities who are getting excluded from school for behavioural issues"
    
2. And secondly Teachers - "Specialist teaching staff who are tasked with managing students with behavioural issues"
    

  

### Activities 

ImpactModel.Example.Activities

For Activities  there might be a couple of main components

1. One might be - Students attend a weekly mentoring programme which comprises one-to-one mentoring as well as group work
    
2. A second one might be -mentor staff work with specialist teachers to collaborate on a plan to support the student through their journey 
    

  

### Short-term outcomes  
ImpactModel.Example.ShortTermOutcomes

For short-team outcomes these are the immediate things that will happen as a result of the activities. This can be a mixture of "outputs" and "outcomes". and might look like:

1. Students regularly attend the mentoring and group sessions
    
2. Each mentor/student paring produces a plan
    
3. Specialist teachers engage with mentors on the above plans
    
4. Students feel engaged in the process
    

  

### Medium-term outcomes  
ImpactModel.Example.MediumTermOutcomes

And medium-term outcomes... what happens over the next 1-2 years. Perhaps:

1. Students feel more engaged at school, have better attendance and get in less trouble
    
2. And - they are achieving better results in their school work at the end of the year
    

### Long-term outcomes  
ImpactModel.Example.LongTermOutcomes

Long-term outcomes... what happens over the next 2-10 years

1. Students are more likely to finish school and achieve in their results
    
2. They are more confident in their learning and abilities
    
3. They're more prepared to find stable employment
    
4. And they are less likely to experience negative social outcomes like addiction and violence
    

### Impact  
ImpactModel.Example.Impact

Impact... what ultimately is going to happen as a result of this enterprise?

1. Something like - "Young people who experience challenges in life are going on to become happy, healthy and valuable members of the community"
    
2. Now it's important to note that this enterprise will not be able to claim that they alone will have caused this impact.
    
3. But by fleshing out their impact model and measuring their outcomes over time they can prove (and need to be able to prove) that 1. the long-term outcomes they predict are in fact occurring and 2. that the work they are doing is a significant cause of these outcomes
    

**ImpactModel.Overview**
1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,280
Just as your customer model describes how
you create customer value, your impact

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,890
model shows how you create social value.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,140
It shows how your activities are
gonna generate positive social or

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,035
environmental outcomes that will
then create your long-term impact.

5
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:22,185
Based on what you've described in the
purpose section of the canvas, your

6
00:00:22,185 --> 00:00:27,045
impact model will show the chain of
causality, the logic by which your

7
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:31,845
intentions will translate into impact
that will actually occur in the world.

8
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:36,615
And this will get you beyond mere hopes
and assumptions about the positive

9
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:41,355
change you're going to cause and get
real about how this will actually happen.



**ImpactModel.Overview.Context**

1
00:00:00,113 --> 00:00:02,813
Depending on what you're trying
to achieve, your impact model

2
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:04,673
will be more or less complicated.

3
00:00:05,363 --> 00:00:09,923
This template will allow you to sketch out
each component of your impact model as a

4
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:11,933
simple starting point for you to build on.

5
00:00:12,683 --> 00:00:15,563
This is just one template for
developing an impact model.

6
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:20,513
There are many others, so feel free to use
a different one if you know it better or

7
00:00:20,513 --> 00:00:24,743
if it's the one used by your organization,
funder or program that you're in.

8
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:29,303
If your impact model's relatively
simple, it may have just a single

9
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:33,353
line that maps your impact from
issue through to final impact.

10
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:37,103
But if it's more complex, then
you may have several and they

11
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,993
may interact in complex ways.

12
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:42,453
If this is the case, it's gonna
take a bit more time and effort

13
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:44,013
to develop your impact model.

14
00:00:44,643 --> 00:00:48,633
That said, also make sure that
you're not making your impact model

15
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:50,523
more complex than it needs to be.

16
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:54,903
It can be tempting to add in every
positive thing that your business

17
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:59,913
could do, but keep it simple by
focusing only on the impact components

18
00:00:59,913 --> 00:01:01,863
that truly align with your purpose.


**ImpactModel.Overview.Disclaimer**
1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,380
This impact logic you are creating here
tells the story of how the things you do

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:10,510
will solve real issues for real people
in a predictable and measurable way.

3
00:00:11,425 --> 00:00:15,535
But of course there are often many, many
more factors causing these issues than

4
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:17,455
you could hope to address on your own.

5
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:21,475
Complex problems cannot be
solved with one simple fix.

6
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:26,095
So your impact model needs to reflect
that you understand the system that is

7
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:31,555
producing the issues you want to solve,
and that based on this understanding your

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,085
intervention often in conjunction with
other people's work will influence this

9
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:38,845
system in a significant and positive way.


**ImpactModel.Issue**
1
00:00:00,043 --> 00:00:03,373
The issue section of your
impact model draws directly

2
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:04,933
from your purpose statement.

3
00:00:05,323 --> 00:00:09,013
The issue is the thing you are really
trying to address with your enterprise,

4
00:00:09,073 --> 00:00:13,903
the problem you are trying to solve
for this first pass through the canvas,

5
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:18,043
describe the issue in a high level
way, but even though you're only gonna

6
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:22,468
describe it simply here in the canvas,
you do need to understand it deeply.

7
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:26,288
Or at least be on the journey
to understanding it deeply.

8
00:00:26,738 --> 00:00:29,978
Otherwise, you can't hope to
do anything useful about it.


**

ImpactModel.Participants
1
00:00:00,097 --> 00:00:03,637
the participants in your impact
model are your stakeholders, the

2
00:00:03,697 --> 00:00:08,167
people or organizations who will
participate in your impact activities.

3
00:00:08,977 --> 00:00:12,967
This will include any core beneficiary
groups that you're serving, as

4
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:16,357
well as other key people and
organizations who will engage with

5
00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:17,737
you on your impact activities.

6
00:00:18,862 --> 00:00:23,302
A participant might also be a
customer in your customer model if

7
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:27,322
they play a key role in making your
broader business model work as well.


**ImpactModel.Activities**
1
00:00:00,028 --> 00:00:03,028
Your activities are the things
your participants will do

2
00:00:03,028 --> 00:00:04,828
because of your enterprise.

3
00:00:05,488 --> 00:00:08,698
They will ultimately lead to the
impact that you want to have.

4
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:12,778
Activities could be, for
example, a participant group

5
00:00:12,778 --> 00:00:14,278
attends a training program.

6
00:00:14,278 --> 00:00:18,633
You offer installs, solar lighting,
plants, trees, receives medical

7
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:19,978
treatment, things like that.

8
00:00:20,758 --> 00:00:24,958
It'll be different for every impact
model, but the activities need

9
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:28,348
to be the things that ultimately
cause the impact to happen.

10
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:32,968
These impact activities will
also be outlined in the solution

11
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:34,858
section of your customer model.



**ImpactModel.ShortTermOutcomes**
1
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:03,823
Following from the activities,
you need to map out the short-term

2
00:00:03,823 --> 00:00:05,683
outcomes that will flow from them.

3
00:00:06,643 --> 00:00:11,053
These are the positive outcomes that will
result immediately from your activities

4
00:00:11,293 --> 00:00:15,613
and be the first small step towards
the impact that you're trying to have.



**ImpactModel.MediumTermOutcomes**
1
00:00:00,021 --> 00:00:03,651
Medium term outcomes are the
positive changes that will follow

2
00:00:03,651 --> 00:00:05,721
on from your short term outcomes.

3
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:09,861
They are the measurable changes that
are going to occur over the next,

4
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:15,411
say, one to two years as a direct
result of these short term outcomes.



**ImpactModel.LongTermOutcomes**

1
00:00:00,065 --> 00:00:04,205
Your long-term outcomes are the
long-term positive changes that will

2
00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:08,645
follow from your short and medium
term outcomes, perhaps across,

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,135
uh, two to 10 year time horizon.



**ImpactModel.Impact**
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,526
The final impact section of your
impact model describes what the

2
00:00:03,526 --> 00:00:07,096
state of the world will be like
when you have achieved your purpose.

3
00:00:07,756 --> 00:00:11,446
It is the destination of your
activities and your short,

4
00:00:11,536 --> 00:00:13,636
medium, and long-term outcomes.

5
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:17,026
It should be simple, short and high level.

6
00:00:17,236 --> 00:00:19,516
It's okay for it to be a bit abstract.

7
00:00:19,756 --> 00:00:23,176
The detail you capture and your
outcomes will make it concrete.

8
00:00:23,926 --> 00:00:25,696
It is describing the world.

9
00:00:25,756 --> 00:00:29,086
After all the steps of your impact
model have been delivered on.

**ImpactModel.Example.Intro**
1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:02,617
Let's walk through an example
to help understand how to

2
00:00:02,617 --> 00:00:03,937
fill in your impact model.

3
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:08,197
Imagine an enterprise that delivers
its impact through providing mentoring

4
00:00:08,197 --> 00:00:12,037
programs for kids who are getting kicked
out of school for behavioral issues.

5
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:15,757
This is a fake enterprise just for
the sake of understanding the process.




**ImpactModel.Example.Issue**
1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,050
The issue would relate to the
enterprise's purpose statement.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,790
The issue might be something like,
young people are falling out of school

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,960
because they aren't getting the support
they need to overcome solvable problems.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,150
This is creating long-term issues around
lack of employment, lack of self-esteem,

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,710
and other social issues affecting them,
their families, and the wider community.



 **ImpactModel.Example.Participants**
1
00:00:00,063 --> 00:00:03,303
Participants will be the various
key stakeholders that they need

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:06,903
to work together in order to
make the impact model work.

3
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:13,983
For example, firstly, students say
students between the ages of 14 to 17

4
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:16,473
at schools in low income communities.

5
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:19,913
Who are excluded from school
for behavioral issues.

6
00:00:20,273 --> 00:00:24,983
And then secondly, teachers specialist
teaching staff who are tasked with

7
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,143
managing students with behavioral issues.



**ImpactModel.Example.Activities**

1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,211
For activities, there might be
a couple of main components.

2
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:07,231
One might be students attend
a weekly mentoring program,

3
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:11,311
which comprises of one-to-one
mentoring as well as group work.

4
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:16,201
A second one might be mentor staff,
work with specialist teachers to

5
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:19,741
collaborate on a plan to support
students through their journey.





**ImpactModel.Example.ShortTermOutcomes**
1
00:00:00,032 --> 00:00:04,832
For short term, a uh, 3, 2, 1,
and go for short term outcomes.

2
00:00:04,892 --> 00:00:08,882
These are the immediate things that will
happen as a result of the activities.

3
00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:13,412
This can be a mixture of outputs and
outcomes and might look something

4
00:00:13,412 --> 00:00:17,822
like students regularly attend
the mentoring and group sessions.

5
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:22,742
Each mentor student pairing
produces a plan specialist.

6
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:27,542
Teachers engage with mentors
on the above plans and students

7
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:29,342
feel engaged in the process.


**ImpactModel.Example.MediumTermOutcomes**

1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,070
3, 2, 1, and go.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,380
And medium term outcomes.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,900
What happens over the
next one to two years?

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,430
Perhaps students feel more engaged
at school, have better attendance,

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,270
and get in less trouble, and they're
achieving better results in their

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,980
school work at the end of the year.


**ImpactModel.Example.LongTermOutcomes**

1
00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:01,414
long-term outcomes.

2
00:00:01,414 --> 00:00:04,144
What happens over the
next two to 10 years?

3
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:08,404
Students are more likely to finish
school and achieve in their results.

4
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:10,984
They're more confident in
their learning abilities.

5
00:00:10,984 --> 00:00:15,244
They're more prepared to find
stable employment, and they're less

6
00:00:15,244 --> 00:00:19,564
likely to experience negative social
outcomes like addiction and violence.


**ImpactModel.Example.Impact**

1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:04,629
impact what ultimately is gonna
happen as a result of this enterprise.

2
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:09,219
Something like young people who
experience challenges in life are

3
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:13,089
going to become happy, healthy, and
valuable members of the community.

4
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:17,619
Now it's important to note that this
enterprise will not be able to claim that

5
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:20,049
they alone will have caused this impact.

6
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:25,419
But by fleshing out their impact model and
measuring their outcomes over time, they

7
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:31,749
can prove and indeed need to be able to
prove that, one, the long-term outcomes

8
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:37,239
they predict are in fact occurring, and
two, that the work they are doing is

9
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,579
a significant cause of these outcomes.
