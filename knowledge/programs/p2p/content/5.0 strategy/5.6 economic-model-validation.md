**[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas - Economic Model section highlighted]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
You're about to work through the Core content on economic model validation. This covers what customer validation already proved about your economics, validating channels, revenue, costs, and advantage, and using integrated MVPs to test multiple assumptions together.

When you come back,  we'll talk about economic model validation at P2P scale.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Channels | Revenue | Costs | Advantage | Integrated testing]**

**Tag line:** **Prove the economics work.**

## P2P COMMENTARY

p2p 5.6 economic-model-validation 2.webm

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Economic Validation for PPVs"]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just walked you through economic model validation. Now let's talk about what this looks like at PPV scale.

**Tag line:** **P2P economic validation.**

### Economics at Small Scale

**[MAIN PANEL: Small scale economics diagram]**

First, remember your economics work at a different scale than funded startups and social enterprises.

Your breakeven is lower. Your fixed costs are minimal. You don't need massive volume to be sustainable - you need the right margins with modest volume.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Lower breakeven | Minimal fixed costs | Margins over volume]**

This changes what you're validating. You're not proving you can get to 100,000 customers. You might be proving that you can get to 1,000 at the right price with manageable costs.

Validate at YOUR scale, not someone else's.

**Tag line:** **Validate your scale.**

### Keep It Lightweight - But Test Key Advantage Dynamics

**[MAIN PANEL: Simple validation focus diagram]**

Don't over-complicate your economic validation with complex financial modeling before you have proof.

You don't need detailed three-year projections. You need to prove unit economics are positive and channels can deliver enough customers for you to grow at acceptable cost.

The detailed financial modeling comes later when you're in execution mode.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Unit economics positive | Channels work | Keep simple]**


**Test your advantage assumptions** -  If you're counting on higher-than-average word-of-mouth customer acquisition, you need to prove this will actually happen. Test whether your early customers refer others at the rate you're assuming.

If you're planning to charge a premium based on your social mission or purpose alignment, validate that customers will actually pay it. Don't assume mission justifies higher pricing - prove it.

If your leverage depends on specific dynamics - like community creating content, or network effects kicking in at certain scale, or platform efficiencies - test whether these dynamics actually work the way you think.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Word-of-mouth rate? | Mission premium? | Key dynamics work?]**

Your advantage assumptions are critical to your economic model. If they don't work, your economics might not work. Validate them early.

**Tag line:** **Test advantage assumptions.**

### AI Tools for Economic Validation

**[MAIN PANEL: AI economic modeling workflow]**

AI tools can help you validate economic assumptions that used to require financial analysts or consultants.

**Unit economics modeling:** Build financial models that test different scenarios - pricing, volume, costs. See where breakeven happens under different assumptions.

**Channel cost analysis:** Research typical CAC for your channels and business model type. Understand what's realistic before you spend money testing.

**Pricing research:** Analyze competitor pricing, willingness-to-pay data, and market benchmarks to validate your pricing assumptions.

**Cohort analysis:** Model retention and lifetime value scenarios based on different churn assumptions.

This can give you valuable insights and baselines for what to test in your experiments. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Model scenarios | Research CAC | Analyze pricing | Project LTV]**

For example, Plausible Analytics could have used AI to model unit economics at different scales. If they charge $9/month and host costs are $2/customer/month, what happens at 100 customers versus 1,000 versus 10,000? When do they hit breakeven? What do their margins look like as they scale?

They could use AI to research pricing of comparable services and then test those price bands with an online signup flow.

They could research typical CAC for developer tools sold through content marketing and Product Hunt. They could then validate this through some online market testing that drives traffic to the same online signup flow.

This analysis that would have cost thousands from consultants, they can do themselves with AI assistance.

**Tag line:** **AI models economics.**

### Integrated MVP Validation

**[MAIN PANEL: Integrated MVP diagram showing customer + economic + impact validation]**

The Core Framework talked about MVPs that validate multiple assumptions simultaneously.

One well-designed experiment can validate multiple customer, economic, and impact assumptions together.

**[VISUAL TEXT: One experiment | Multiple models validated | Efficient]**

Let's look at examples from the library:

**Tag line:** **Integrated efficiency.**

---

#### Example: DesignJoy Economic Validation

**[MAIN PANEL: DesignJoy MVP validation]**

DesignJoy could have validated their economic model through a simple MVP: Offer unlimited design subscription to five clients for one month at their target price point.

This would validate customer assumptions - do agencies actually want unlimited design? Will they use it enough to justify the subscription?

It validates economic assumptions - can one designer handle five unlimited clients profitably? What are the actual time costs per client? Does the subscription price cover costs with healthy margin? What's the realistic client capacity?

**[VISUAL TEXT: 5 clients | 1 month | Target price | Multiple validations]**

One MVP, multiple models validated efficiently. After one month, they know if the model works or needs adjustment.

**Tag line:** **One test, many answers.**

---

#### Example: Linking Your Thinking Economic Model Validation

**[MAIN PANEL: LYT workshop MVP]**

Linking Your Thinking could have validated their economics through a pilot workshop. Run one cohort of 30 people at the target price point.

Customer validation - does the workshop format work? Is the content valuable? Will people complete it?

Economic validation - does the pricing work? Can one person run a cohort of 30 profitably? What are the actual time costs? What does customer acquisition cost through content marketing? Do customers refer new customers?

Impact validation - are people actually improving their thinking systems? Are they getting the outcomes they came for?

**[VISUAL TEXT: 30 people | Target price | Can one person run it? | All models tested]**

One pilot cohort validates the full model. If it works at 30, they can scale to multiple cohorts. If it doesn't, they learn what to fix before investing more.

**Tag line:** **Pilot proves model.**

---

#### Example: Buy Me Once Economic Validation

**[MAIN PANEL: Buy Me Once marketplace MVP]**

Buy Me Once could validate their marketplace economics with a curated pilot. List 50 products in one category - say, kitchen items. Drive traffic through content about buying quality over quantity.

Customer validation - will people buy through the platform? Does the curation add value? Do customers trust the recommendations?

Economic validation - what's conversion rate from visitor to buyer? What affiliate commission or margin can they earn per transaction? What's CAC through content marketing? Can organic content drive enough traffic?

Impact validation - are customers choosing durable products they wouldn't have found otherwise? Is this actually reducing waste?

**[VISUAL TEXT: 50 products | 1 category | Content traffic | Full model tested]**

One focused pilot validates whether the marketplace model works before building out hundreds of product listings.

**Tag line:** **Curated pilot proves concept.**

---

### Your Turn

**[MAIN PANEL: Economic Model section on canvas]**

Now apply this to your economic validation.

Use AI tools to support this, and look for integrated MVP opportunities. Can one experiment validate your customer, economic, and impact models together? This could be the most efficient path forward.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Your scale | Test advantage | AI tools | Integrated MVPs]**

**Create your validation plan document** as outlined in the Core content section. What will prove your economic model works? What metrics will show positive unit economics? What CAC is acceptable? What conversion rates do you need? List your experiments to prove these metrics with clear success criteria.

And remember: customer validation already proved a lot. You know people will pay. You know channels exist. Now you're proving the economics work at the scale you need with the dynamics you're counting on.
