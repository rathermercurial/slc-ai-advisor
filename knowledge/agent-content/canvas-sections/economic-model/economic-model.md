# Economic Model

The Economic Model clarifies how customer value creation translates into a financially sustainable operation. It ensures the enterprise can maintain and scale its impact through viable economics.

## Purpose

The economic model answers the critical question: "How will this enterprise sustain itself financially while delivering impact?" It bridges the gap between creating value for customers and generating the resources needed to continue operations.

## Components

### [Channels](channels/channels.md)
Mechanisms to scale customer acquisition (marketing channels) and product/service distribution (distribution channels).

### [Revenue](revenue/revenue.md)
Regular income sources at scale (sales, donations, grants, sponsorship).

### [Costs](costs/costs.md)
Major ongoing expenses necessary to deliver the solution and achieve impact.

### [Advantage](advantage/advantage.md)
The specific strategic strengths or leverage points enabling financial viability and long-term success.

### [Financial Model](financial-model/financial-model.md)
Overview of key revenue streams and major costs, demonstrating sustainability at scale.

## Key Considerations

- **Sustainability**: Can the model support ongoing operations?
- **Scalability**: Will unit economics improve or worsen with growth?
- **Diversification**: Are revenue sources resilient and diverse?
- **Impact Alignment**: Do economic incentives support or conflict with impact goals?
