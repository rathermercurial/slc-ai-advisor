### The Startup Journey

Let's look at the journey from startup business model idea to successful venture, to understand how we move from guessing at a business model to designing one that works.

If you're new to startups, this may differ a lot from how you've thought about building organizations in the past. The modern startup approach is fundamentally different from the way that established businesses operate. 

`[MAIN PANEL: Startup journey overview diagram]`


This section on the startup journey gives you a framework and a set of concepts that will help you make sense of what needs to happen, in what order and why.

This modern startup approach also arms you to respond to people recycling old-school  business advice about how to develop a venture. Or people from the nonprofit sector who might have old ideas about how purpose-driven ventures "should" be built.

Here's what we'll cover: 
	1. the fundamental difference between a startup and a business, 
	2. what the journey from one to the other looks like, 
	3. and what your venture will look like across this journey.

### Definition of a Startup

First, let's look at what it means to be a startup. And by "startup" I am meaning someone who innovating on a new idea that has some sort of economic engine, and in your case also an impact component. 

Knowing the difference between a startup and a business will shape your whole journey.

A startup isn't a small version of a big business. It's a fundamentally different thing.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Startup: temporary org to search | Business: permanent org to execute]`

As Steve Blank puts it, a startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable, scalable business model. A business is a permanent organization designed to execute on a repeatable, scalable business model.

In the startup phase, your job is to test the idea, learn, evolve it, and only once it's right, shift focus to execution.

`[MAIN PANEL: Search vs Execute comparison]`

This is the single most important point to grasp. Many startups jump straight to execution, get buried in operations, and never prove the model. They money and pour energy into trying to make a broken model work. And by the time they realize the model is wrong, they're too deeply committed to change direction. They either fail outright or fall way short of their potential.

This distinction is even more important for building purpose-driven ventures. Because you have the added complexity of an impact model to integrate, it's even more critical to test and learn, not just guess at the business model. There are too many things to get wrong. 

**Tag line: "Search first, then execute"**

### From Startup to Business

A startup searches for a repeatable, scalable business model by moving through cycles of validation and iteration.

You start with your initial business model idea. You map it into your Social Lean Canvas. Then you begin validating.

`[MAIN PANEL: Build-Measure-Learn cycle diagram]`

Validation means taking the assumptions inside your model - your untested guesses about how it's going to work - and testing them against reality to see if they hold up.

We take a scientific approach using a process called Build, Measure, and Learn. You build an experiment. You measure the results. You learn from what happened. Then you build the next experiment, informed by what you learned.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Build → Measure → Learn → Build]`

You start with the riskiest assumptions first - the ones that would kill the venture if wrong.

Then you fold what you learn back into the model. That's iteration, one version of your business model after the next until you have it right. Fewer guesses, more proven facts, a model that reflects reality and becomes increasingly likely to work.

This is exactly how an investor and funder would look for in a venture as well. The more it has been de-risked, the more likely it is to succeed and therefore the more likely someone is to want to fund it. 

### The Transition

Over time, you transition from mostly experimentation and learning to more and more execution as your confidence in the business model grows.

`[MAIN PANEL: Startup journey diagram showing transition]`

This is how a starting theory full of assumptions becomes a tight, validated business model. And how your organization shifts from a creative, flexible, networked startup to a structured, efficient, scalable business.

Your venture starting out on the left side of this diagram looks very different from when it gets to the right side. Left side - you're experimenting, learning, pivoting. Right side - you're executing, optimizing, scaling.

The journey from left to right is what we're mapping in this program. Business model design, improvement, validation, and strategy - these are the tools that move you through this transition.

**Tag line: "Validation becomes execution over time"**

### Founders First

In the startup phase, it's on you - the founders - to figure things out. You might bring others in later, but at the start, it's you.
 It's tempting to try to outsource some of the hardest bits. But don't fall into that trap.

`[MAIN PANEL: Founder at center of early-stage organization]`

During early validation and iteration, founders must hold the key roles in the organization and make the key decisions. Later, once the model is validated and you're starting to execute at scale, you can hire specialists. But don't hand your canvas to an "expert" to fill in the hard sections for you.

For example, in the startup phase, understanding your customers and crafting your unique value proposition is founders work. You can't hire a marketing person to do this for you. You need to learn from the customer firsthand and build the business model around them. Later you can hire marketing people to execute on your marketing.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Early stage: founder-led | Don't outsource model design]`

Get advice from people who know more than you. But you make the calls. Don't outsource crucial business model design.

This is what the Social Lean Canvas is desiged to help with, it keeps all the key pieces together in one coherent model so you can know what to do, when to do it, and can be the founder you need to be.

17
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,780
First, let's look at what
it means to be a startup.

18
00:01:04,293 --> 00:01:08,762
By startup, I'm meaning Someone
who's innovating on a new idea that

19
00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:12,514
has some sort of economic engine

00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:14,412
some sort of impact component.

21
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:18,421
Knowing the difference between
a startup and a business will

22
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:19,621
shape your whole journey.

23
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:23,034

As Steve Blank puts it, A startup is a
temporary organization designed to search

26
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,940
for a repeatable, scalable business model.

27
00:01:33,312 --> 00:01:38,104
A business is a permanent
organization designed to execute on a

28
00:01:38,104 --> 00:01:40,343
repeatable, scalable business model.

29
00:01:40,912 --> 00:01:46,473
In the startup phase, your job is to
test the idea, learn, evolve it, and

30
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:49,268
only once it's right, shift to execution.

31
00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:52,767
This is the single most
important point to grasp.

32
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:57,169
Many startups jump straight to
execution, get buried in operations,

33
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,822
and never prove their model.

34
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:02,652
They pour money and energy into
trying to make a broken business

model work, by the time they
realize the model is wrong, they're

00:02:06,235 --> 00:02:08,565
too  committed to change direction.

37
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,357
They either fail outright or fall
way short of their potential.

38
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:16,949
This distinction is even more important
for building purpose driven ventures

39
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:21,041
because you have the added complexity
of an impact model to integrate.

40
00:02:21,278 --> 00:02:24,908
It's even more critical to test
and learn and not just guess.

41
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:25,838
At the business model.

42
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,525
There are too many things to get wrong.

43
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:32,433
A startup searches for a repeatable,

initial business model idea.

46
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,360
You map it into your social link canvas,
and then you begin validating it.

47
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:48,582
Validation means taking the assumptions
inside your model, your untested

48
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:52,671
guesses about how it's going to
work, and testing them against

49
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:54,538
reality to see if they hold up.

51
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:03,707
You build an experiment,
you measure the results.

52
00:03:03,857 --> 00:03:05,207
You learn from what happened.

53
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:09,056
Then you build the next experiment
informed by what you have learned.

54
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:13,217
You start with the riskiest assumptions
first, the ones that would kill

55
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:14,717
your venture if they were wrong.

56
00:03:15,088 --> 00:03:18,088
Then you fold what you've
learned back into your model.

57
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:21,552
That's iteration, one version
of your business model after the

58
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:23,202
next, until you have it, right?

59
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,355
Fewer guesses, more proven facts.

60
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,973
A model that reflects reality and
becomes increasingly likely to work.

61
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:34,920
That's exactly how an investor or a
funder would look at a venture as well.

62
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:39,762
The more it has been de-risked, the more
likely it is to succeed, and therefore the

63
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,802
more likely someone is to want to fund it.

64
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:47,053
Over time you transition from mostly
experimentation and learning to more

65
00:03:47,053 --> 00:03:51,806
and more execution as your confidence
in the business model grows, This is how

66
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:56,158
a starting theory full of assumptions
becomes a tight validated business model.

67
00:03:56,923 --> 00:04:02,811
And how your organization shifts from a
creative, flexible network startup into a

68
00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:05,301
structured, efficient, scalable business.

69
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:10,113
Your venture starting out on the left side
of the diagram looks very different from

70
00:04:10,113 --> 00:04:12,413
when it gets to the right side, left side.

71
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:17,300
You're experimenting, learning, pivoting,
right side you are executing, optimizing

72
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,475
and scaling the journey from left to right
is what we are mapping in this program.

73
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:26,590
Business model, design improvement,
validation, and strategy.

74
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:30,722
These are the tools that move you
reliably through this transition.

75
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:35,921
In the startup phase, it's on you,
the founders, to figure things out.

76
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:39,666
You might bring in others later
on, but at the start, it's you.

77
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,451
It's tempting to try and outsource
some of the hardest bits, but

78
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:44,746

79
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,570
During early validation and
iteration, Founders must hold

80
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,898
the key roles in the organization
and make the key decisions later.

81
00:04:52,903 --> 00:04:56,588
Once the model is validated and
you're starting to execute at scale,

82
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,881
you can hire specialists, but don't
hand your canvas to an expert.

83
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:03,491
And ask them to fill in
the hard sections for you.

84
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:07,785
For example, in the startup phase,
understanding your customers

85
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:11,265
and crafting your unique value
proposition is founder's work.

86
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:14,467
You can't hire a marketing
person to do this for you.

87
00:05:14,902 --> 00:05:18,328
You need to learn from your
customers firsthand and build

88
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:19,978
the business model around them.

89
00:05:20,345 --> 00:05:23,490
Later you can hire marketing people
to execute on your marketing.

90
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:28,384
Get advice from people who know more than
you, but you make the critical cause.

91
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:30,834
Don't outsource crucial
business model design.

92
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:35,841
This is what the Social Lean Canvas is
designed to help with It keeps all the key

93
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:40,583
pieces together in one coherent model so
you can know what to do, when to do it,

94
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,079
and can be the founder you need to be.
