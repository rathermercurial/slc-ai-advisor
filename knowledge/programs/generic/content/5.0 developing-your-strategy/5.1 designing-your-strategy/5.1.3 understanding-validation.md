## Section 5.1.3: Understanding Validation (REVISED v2)

**Tag line: "Test, learn, evolve"**

### Building on What You Know

You've already encountered validation earlier in this program. In the business model design module, we talked about how successful ventures evolve through testing and iteration.

And in the improving your business model module, you identified the riskiest assumptions in your customer, impact, and economic models. You created lists of what needs to be validated.

Now we're going to build on that foundation. We're going to turn those lists of risky assumptions into a systematic validation strategy.

### The Validation Journey

No successful venture ended up with the exact business model it started with. Every successful business model changes and evolves as founders discover insights that make it better.

The goal with validation is for this not to be a haphazard process. Not trial and error where getting things wrong destroys your venture.

Validation is the methodical process where you gain the benefits of learning without destroying your venture in the process.

`[MAIN PANEL: Build-Measure-Learn cycle diagram]`

We call this Build, Measure, and Learn. You build an experiment. You measure the results. You learn from what happened. Then you build the next experiment, informed by what you learned.

`[VISUAL TEXT: build → measure → learn → build]`

Remember those risky assumption lists you created in the improving your business model module? Those become your validation roadmap. Each assumption gets tested through this cycle until you've removed the biggest risks from your business model.

### In the Early Stages, Validation IS Progress

Here's something critical to understand: In the early stages of your venture, validation equals progress.

You're not executing yet. You're not scaling. You're learning. And learning is the work.

Your progress isn't measured in revenue or customers served or impact created. It's measured in assumptions tested, insights gained, and risks removed.

`[VISUAL TEXT: early stage: validation = progress]`


### What Good Validation Looks Like

Good validation has three key characteristics.

`[VISUAL TEXT: fastest/cheapest | based on reality | riskiest first]`

**First: It's the fastest, cheapest way to prove or disprove a theory.**

Don't build when you can sketch. Don't sketch when you can ask. Don't invest months and thousands of dollars when you can get an answer in a week for a few hundred.



Each step answers questions at the appropriate level of investment.

**Second: It's based on reality as much as possible.**

Asking people "Would you buy this?" isn't validation. People lie. Not maliciously - they just tell you what they think you want to hear. Or what they aspirationally believe about themselves rather than what they actually do.

Good validation is based on what people actually do, not what they say they'll do.


**Third: You start by testing the riskiest assumptions first.**

You identified these risky assumptions in the previous module. Some of them create existential threats to your business model. If they turn out to be wrong, the whole model fails. Others can be navigated around if needed.

Test the existential risks first. Only after you're confident the foundation is solid do you test the smaller risks.


### Optimization Comes Later

Once you've validated the critical assumptions and your business model is starting to work, you'll transition to optimization mode.

That's where you make many small improvements. Testing different pricing points. Refining your messaging. Optimizing your channels. You'll do this forever - continuous improvement.

But don't confuse early-stage validation with optimization. Don't fall into the trap of premature optimization - perfecting things that don't matter yet while ignoring the existential questions.

`[VISUAL TEXT: first validate it works | then optimize how well]`

The Toast Ale founders shouldn't be investing in branded glassware or perfecting label design before they know if anyone will buy the beer. They shouldn't be building distributor relationships before they've proven people want the product.

First validate. Then optimize.

### Two Types of Validation

There are two types of validation you'll use, and understanding the difference matters.

`[MAIN PANEL: Qualitative vs Quantitative comparison diagram]`

**Qualitative validation is high-bandwidth exploration.**

You're having deep, open-ended conversations. You're observing behavior. You're discovering things you didn't know you needed to know.

This is where you learn the language customers use to describe their problems. The words that resonate. The frames that make sense to them. You're looking for non-obvious insights that unlock your business model's potential.

You're also learning about the customer segment itself. What connects these people? What themes cut across the group? Where might early adopters be hiding?

Be an anthropologist. Don't interrogate. Don't pitch. Explore. You don't know what you don't know, and qualitative validation lets you discover it.
 

They're listening for the frameworks, the language, the motivations. They might discover that "waste bread" positioning is actually compelling - it tells a story. Or they might discover it creates concerns about quality. Either way, they learn.

**Quantitative validation is narrow, focused proof at scale.**

You've learned something in qualitative validation. Now you need to prove it works at the scale your business model requires.

Where qualitative might involve twenty deep conversations, quantitative might involve a thousand quick interactions. An email campaign. A landing page. A small production run sold through specific channels.

You're not discovering new insights here. You're confirming what you learned works in practice, at scale, with numbers that matter.

`[VISUAL TEXT: qualitative = high-bandwidth discovery | quantitative = scaled proof]`

  

### The Sequence: Qualitative First

You almost always start with qualitative validation.

`[VISUAL TEXT: qualitative = discover | quantitative = prove at scale]`

This is because the biggest risks often live in your customer model, and customer understanding requires qualitative work first. You need to understand the humans before you can scale the numbers.

Qualitative is also usually faster and cheaper. You don't need infrastructure. You don't need to build product. You just need to find people and talk with them.

But here's the truth: this can feel uncomfortable at first.

If you're comfortable with conversations, this will feel natural. If approaching strangers makes you uncomfortable, that's normal. The discomfort actually means you're doing something valuable - you're learning things that matter, things you can't learn any other way.

It gets easier with practice.

This is founder work. You can't delegate these early conversations. You need to experience customers firsthand. You need to hear their exact words, see their reactions, feel their hesitations.

Only founders can do the creative work of fitting new insights into the business model and seeing if it makes it stronger.

For the Toast Ale founders, this means getting out and talking to craft beer drinkers. Visiting bakeries to understand their surplus bread situation. Having conversations in bottle shops. Running informal taste tests.

It's uncomfortable at first. It gets easier. And the insights you gain are worth it.

Then, once you've discovered insights through qualitative work, you move to quantitative validation. You test whether what worked in twenty conversations works at scale

### A Note on Intellectual Property

Before we dive in, a quick word about intellectual property concerns.

One question that often comes up is: "How can I validate my business model without risking someone stealing my IP?"

Here are a few thoughts that will help you consider how to approach this.

First, most people aren't interested in your idea. We often put way too much stock in our ideas being unique. Generally speaking, there will always be many people already working on the same ideas as we are.

Second, your idea at the start is not good enough to bother copying. Most ideas in the beginning are pretty obvious and not very valuable. Their value comes when you start validating them and learning nuanced insights from your customers and evolving the product around these insights.

Because of this, even if someone tried to copy your idea, they wouldn't have your deep customer insights shaping the evolution of the product. Just what they see in the current snapshot.

Third, when we hide, we lose the value of having a community help us. We miss all the opportunities for feedback, advice, support, recruitment, investment, and so on that could arise if we were out talking about what we're doing.

`[VISUAL TEXT: most ideas aren't unique | value comes from insights | hiding limits help]`

That said, there are times when an idea does represent intellectual property and should be protected. This is especially true when it comes out of academic research or is a physical invention of some kind, or involves specific materials and formulations.

If you're working on one of these, then definitely take IP protection seriously. If this is the case, there are a few things to consider:

What can you do to protect your IP so that you can speak about it?

What can you share that will help you validate your product or service without sharing your IP? You can validate a customer segment, their jobs to be done, and the unique value proposition they'll respond to without ever needing to tell them what the solution is. You could tell them what the solution does without showing them how it works.

You could share enough to get a customer or investor interested, and then insist on them signing an NDA before giving them deeper insight into how it works.

Generally speaking though, intellectual property is not often an actual concern. And social entrepreneurs being overly protective of their ideas in the mistaken belief that they need to protect their IP is a much more likely cause for a venture to fail.

But if you are worried, do seek expert advice that is specific to what you're doing.

### Your Validation Plan

In the next three sections, you'll build validation plans for each of your models - customer first, then impact, then economic.

`[MAIN PANEL: Three-part validation journey diagram]`

Each follows the same principles we've just covered - fastest and cheapest, based on reality, riskiest first. But each focuses on different risks and uses different approaches.

Customer model validation centers on discovery and product-market fit. Impact model validation proves your theory of change works. Economic model validation tests whether the business model can scale.

Together, they give you a complete validation strategy.

`[VISUAL TEXT: customer → impact → economic | complete validation strategy]`

Let's start with your customer model.

`[MAIN PANEL: Transition to next section]`


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,405
you've already encountered validation
earlier in this program, in the

2
00:00:03,405 --> 00:00:06,945
business model design module, we
talked about how successful ventures

3
00:00:06,945 --> 00:00:09,015
evolve through testing and iteration.

4
00:00:09,432 --> 00:00:12,660
And in the improving your business
model module, we identified the

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,470
riskiest assumptions in your
customer impact and economic models.

6
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:19,659
and you created a list of
what needs to be validated.

7
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,421
Now we're gonna build on that
foundation, We're going to turn

8
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:27,861
those lists of risky assumptions into
a systematic validation strategy.

9
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:31,676
No successful venture ended up
with the exact business model.

10
00:00:31,676 --> 00:00:36,616
It started with Every successful business
model changes and evolves as founders

11
00:00:36,616 --> 00:00:38,536
discover insights that make it better.

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,649
The goal with validation is
for this not to be a haphazard

13
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:44,746
process, not trial and error.

14
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:46,936
Where getting things wrong
destroys your venture.

15
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:52,120
Validation is a methodical process where
you gain the benefits of learning without

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,040
destroying your venture in the process.

17
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:57,099
We call this build, measure and learn.

18
00:00:57,652 --> 00:00:58,942
You build an experiment.

19
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:00,232
You measure the results.

20
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:01,492
You learn from what happened.

21
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,303
Then you build the next experiment
informed by what you learned.

22
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:09,769
Remember those risky assumption
lists you created in the improving

23
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:10,969
your business model module?

24
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:13,495
Those become your validation roadmap.

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,400
Each assumption gets tested through
the cycle until you've removed the

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,260
biggest risks from your business model.

27
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,429
In the early stages of your
venture, validation equals progress.

28
00:01:24,722 --> 00:01:26,277
You're not executing yet.

29
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:29,866
You're not scaling your
learning,  Learning is the work.

30
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:34,907
Your progress isn't measured in revenue
or customer served or impact created.

31
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:39,815
It's measured in assumptions tested,
insights gained and risks removed.

32
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:44,449
Good validation has three
key characteristics.

33
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:49,469
First, it's the fastest, cheapest
way to prove or disprove a theory.

34
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:51,637
Don't build when you can sketch.

35
00:01:51,637 --> 00:01:53,377
Don't sketch when you can ask.

36
00:01:53,494 --> 00:01:56,975
Don't invest months and thousands
of dollars when you can get answers

37
00:01:56,975 --> 00:01:58,529
in a week for a few hundred.

38
00:01:59,342 --> 00:02:04,020
Second, it's based on reality as much
as possible, asking people, would

39
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,030
you buy This isn't good validation.

40
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:07,784
People lie, not maliciously, they just.

41
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:10,948
They just tell you what they think
you want to hear, or what they

42
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:14,798
aspirationally believe about themselves
rather than what they actually do.

43
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:18,940
Good validation is based on what
people actually do, not what they say.

44
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,151
They'll do third, you start by testing
the riskiest assumptions first.

45
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:27,251
You identified these risky
assumptions in the previous module.

46
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:30,928
Some of them create existential
threats to your business model.

47
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:34,148
If they turn out to be
wrong, the whole model fails.

48
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:36,511
Others can be navigated around if needed.

49
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:40,552
Test the existential risks first,
only after you're confident

50
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:41,872
the foundation is solid.

51
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:43,524
Do you test the smaller risks?

52
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:47,353
Once you've validated these critical
assumptions and your business

53
00:02:47,353 --> 00:02:51,248
model is starting to work, you'll
transition to optimization mode.

54
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,918
That's where you'll make many small
improvements, testing different

55
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:58,632
pricing points, refining your
messaging, optimizing your channels.

56
00:02:58,736 --> 00:03:02,869
You'll do this forever, continuous
improvement, but don't confuse early

57
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:05,089
stage validation with optimization.

58
00:03:05,296 --> 00:03:09,240
Don't fall into the trap of perfecting
things that don't matter yet while

59
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,815
ignoring the existential questions.

60
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:13,541
First,  validate, then optimize.

61
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,994
There are two types of validation
that you'll use, qualitative and

62
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:21,130
quantitative and understanding
the difference really matters.

63
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:24,818
Qualitative validation is
high bandwidth exploration.

64
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,809
You're having deep
open-ended conversations.

65
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:29,309
You are observing behavior.

66
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:32,015
You're discovering things you
didn't know you needed to know.

67
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:35,858
This is when you learn the language
customers use to describe their

68
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:39,834
problems, the words that resonate,
the frames that make sense to them.

69
00:03:40,264 --> 00:03:43,414
You're looking for the non-obvious
insights that unlock your

70
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:44,734
business model's potential.

71
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:47,658
You're also learning about
the customer segment itself.

72
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:49,215
What connects these people?

73
00:03:49,215 --> 00:03:51,135
What themes cut across the group?

74
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,150
Where might early adopters be hiding?

75
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,874
Be an anthropologist.

76
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,184
Don't just interrogate, don't pitch.

77
00:03:57,394 --> 00:03:57,934
Explore.

78
00:03:58,597 --> 00:04:00,037
You don't know what you don't know.

79
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,344
And qualitative validation
lets you discover it.

80
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:06,974
Quantitative validation, on
the other hand, is narrow.

81
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,169
It's focused proof at scale.

82
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:11,963
You've learned something
in qualitative validation.

83
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:14,557
now, you need to prove that
it works at the scale that

84
00:04:14,557 --> 00:04:16,147
your business model requires.

85
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:20,115
Where qualitative might
involve 20 deep conversations.

86
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:24,757
Quantitative might involve a thousand
quick interactions, an email campaign,

87
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:28,952
a landing page, a small production
run, sold through specific channels.

88
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:31,194
You're not discovering new insights here.

89
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,448
You're confirming that what you
learned works in practice at

90
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:36,296
scale with numbers that matter.

91
00:04:37,074 --> 00:04:41,544
It's probably obvious, but you almost
always start with qualitative validation.

92
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:46,378
This is because the biggest risks often
live in your customer model and customer

93
00:04:46,378 --> 00:04:48,448
understanding requires qualitative work.

94
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:52,976
First, you need to understand the humans
before you can scale to the numbers.

95
00:04:53,814 --> 00:04:56,655
Also, qualitative is
usually faster and cheaper.

96
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:58,283
You don't need infrastructure.

97
00:04:58,283 --> 00:04:59,753
You don't need to build products.

98
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,065
You just need to find the right people
and have the right conversation with them.

99
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:05,394
but this can also be difficult.

100
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:09,703
Having conversations with strangers can
feel uncomfortable at first If you're

101
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:13,465
outgoing by nature or experienced
at sales, this will feel natural.

102
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,362
But if approaching strangers makes you
feel uncomfortable, that's normal too.

103
00:05:17,678 --> 00:05:20,558
The discomfort actually means
you're doing something valuable.

104
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:23,873
You're learning things that matter
that you can't learn any other way,

105
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,885
and it gets easier with practice.

106
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:29,584
And remember what we talked about
earlier about founder's work.

107
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:31,234
This is founder's work.

108
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,690
You can't delegate these
early conversations.

109
00:05:33,742 --> 00:05:36,172
You need to experience
customers firsthand.

110
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,594
You need to hear their exact words and see
their reactions, feel their hesitations.

111
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,680
Only founders can do the creative work
of fitting new insights into the business

112
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,600
model and seeing if it makes it stronger.

113
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:52,100
Then once you've discovered insights
through qualitative work, you

114
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,780
move to quantitative validation.

115
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:57,641
You test whether what worked in
20 conversations works at scale.

116
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:02,975
Before we dive deeper, a quick word
on intellectual property concerns.

117
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,780
One question that often comes up
is, how can I validate my business

118
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,060
without risking someone stealing my ip?

119
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:13,101
Here's a few thoughts that will help
you consider how to approach this, but

120
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:15,111
to be clear, this is not legal advice.

121
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:18,246
First, most people aren't
interested in your idea.

122
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:21,871
We often put way too much stock
in our ideas being unique.

123
00:06:22,246 --> 00:06:24,466
No matter how original
we think our idea is.

124
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:28,404
Generally speaking, there will already
be many people working on the same idea.

125
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:32,466
Second, the reality is your
idea at the start is not good

126
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:33,606
enough to bother copying.

127
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:37,602
Most ideas at the beginning are
pretty obvious and not very valuable.

128
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:41,864
The value comes when you evolve
your idea based on nuanced insights.

129
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:44,234
Learn from your customer validation work.

130
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,790
Because of this, even if someone tried
to copy your idea, They wouldn't have

131
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,690
the deep customer insights that is
shaping the evolution of your product.

132
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:55,610
They would only have what they
see in the current snapshot.

133
00:06:56,365 --> 00:07:01,386
Third, when we hide our ip, we lose the
value of having a community to help us.

134
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:04,698
We miss all the opportunities
for feedback, advice, support,

135
00:07:04,698 --> 00:07:06,652
recruitment, investment and so on.

136
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:09,772
That could arise if we were out there
talking about what we were doing.

137
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:14,483
that said, there are times When an
idea represents actual intellectual

138
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:15,778
property, that should be protected.

139
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:20,745
this is especially true when it comes
out of academic research or as a physical

140
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:25,215
invention of some kind, or involves
specific materials and formulations.

141
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,493
If you're working on one of those,
then definitely take IP protection.

142
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:31,888
Seriously, If this is the case,
there are a few things to consider.

143
00:07:32,204 --> 00:07:35,894
Firstly, what can you do to protect
your IP so that you can speak about it?

144
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:38,755
What can you share that will
help you validate your product or

145
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:40,705
service without sharing your ip?

146
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:44,694
You can validate a customer segment,
their jobs to be done, and the unique

147
00:07:44,694 --> 00:07:47,964
value proposition they'll respond
to without even needing to tell

148
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:49,644
them what your solution actually is.

149
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:53,221
You could tell them what the solution
does without showing them how it works.

150
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:56,686
Perhaps could share enough to
get a customer or an investor

151
00:07:56,686 --> 00:08:00,544
interested and then insist on them
signing an NDA before, giving them

152
00:08:00,544 --> 00:08:01,984
deeper insights into how it works.

153
00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:07,042
Generally speaking, though, intellectual
property is often not an actual concern.

154
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:11,144
And social entrepreneurs being overly
protective of their ideas and the

155
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:14,694
mistake and belief that they need
to protect their IP  is a much more

156
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,199
likely cause of a venture failing.

157
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,281
But if you are worried, do
seek expert advice that is

158
00:08:20,281 --> 00:08:21,721
specific to what you are doing.

159
00:08:23,138 --> 00:08:27,218
In the next three sections, you'll build
validation plans for each of your models,

160
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:30,071
customer first,  impact, then economic.

161
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:32,284
Each follows the same principles.

162
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:36,419
We've just covered The fastest, cheapest
way to test your riskiest assumptions

163
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,000
first, but each focuses on different
risks and uses different approaches.

164
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:42,773
customer model validation.

165
00:08:42,863 --> 00:08:45,113
Centers on discovery
and product market fit.

166
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:49,055
Impact model validation proves
your theory of change works,  and

167
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:50,955
economic model validation tests.

168
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:54,080
Whether the business model can
scale together, they give you

169
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,850
a complete validation strategy.

170
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:57,322
Let's start with your customer model.
