## Customer Model

Your customer model outlines how you create value for your customers. Creating value for customers that you can get paid for is what drives your business model. Your customer model pulls together four key sections of the canvas. Your customers, the jobs they need done, the unique value proposition that they will respond to, and the solution that you will give them that they and other of your customers will pay for.

Your customer model could be very simple with a single group of customers who pay for a single, simple product, or it can be much more complex, and social enterprises often tend to be more complex than traditional ones in the customer model. Developing this customer model is about understanding how these four canvas sections come together to form a coherent model of how you create value for your customers.

### Customers (One)

Your customers are those people or organizations that you need to move to make your business model work. You need to categorize them in two ways. Firstly, your customer types, and secondly, your customer segments.

Customer types are the different categories of customers who play completely different roles in your business model. Some businesses only have one customer type, for example, the customer who buys and consumes your product. But in more complex business models, especially in social enterprise, there can be several types of customers. For example, users, funders, advertisers, sponsors, government buyers, all can be different customer types.

With multiple customer types, it's this combination of the different customer types working collectively that creates the value needed for your business model to work. If you have more than one customer type, try to color code or number them in your canvas because each customer type will have a correspondingly different job to be done and different unique value proposition that you'll have to create for them.

### Customers (Two)

For your customer segments, these are the subgroups of customers that sit inside each of your customer types. For the canvas, sketch out the core customer segment that you're going to serve for each of your customer types. For example, if you have a customer type of user, your main user customer segment might be stay home parents.

Keep your customer section simple. Only include those types and segments that you need to make your business model work. Depending on your business model, your participants from your impact model might also be classified as customers, if they are people that you have to move to make your business model work. But if you don't rely on them for your business model to succeed, then don't include them in your customers section.

Any extra customers you include in here that you don't actually need will just add unnecessary complexity to your business model.

### Early Adopters

Your early adopters are the small subgroup of your customer segments who you think will have the strongest desire for your solution. For example, for our customer type of user and our customer segment of stay home parents our early adopters might be stay home parents who have just had their first child. These will be the customers who you will engage with first to learn from and test out your ideas.

Only include early adopters for customer types that will be in significant numbers. If the customer type is, for example, a single government funder, then there's no need to identify early adopters here. Because they're a single customer they don't represent a larger market that you're planning on selling to.
