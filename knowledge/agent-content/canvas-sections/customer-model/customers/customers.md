# Customers

## Definition

**Customers** are the people or organizations that you need to move to make your business model work. Customers is the first section in your Customer Model. They are essential to your enterprise's operation and must be categorized in two ways: **customer types** and **customer segments**.

## Customer Types vs. Customer Segments

### Customer Types
Different categories of customers who play completely different roles in your business model. Examples include:
- Users (who consume the product/service)
- Funders (who provide financial support)
- Advertisers/Sponsors (who pay for access to users)
- Government buyers (who purchase on behalf of beneficiaries)

### Customer Segments
Subgroups of customers within each customer type. For example:
- If your customer type is "users," your segment might be "stay-at-home parents"
- If your customer type is "funders," your segment might be "impact investors"

## Key Principles

1. **Essential Only**: Only include customer types and segments you need to make your business model work
2. **Color Coding**: Use different colors or numbers for multiple customer types on your canvas
3. **Corresponding Elements**: Each customer type requires its own jobs-to-be-done and unique value proposition
4. **Overlap with Impact Model**: Some participants from your impact model may also be customers if you need to move them for your business model to succeed
