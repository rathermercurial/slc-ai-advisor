**Customers** are the people or organizations that you need to move to make your business model work. Customers is the first section in your Customer Model. They are essential to your enterprise's operation and must be categorized in two ways: **customer types** and **customer segments**.

## Customer Types vs. Customer Segments

### Customer Types
Different categories of customers who play completely different roles in your business model. Examples include:
- Users (who consume the product/service)
- Funders (who provide financial support)
- Advertisers/Sponsors (who pay for access to users)
- Government buyers (who purchase on behalf of beneficiaries)

### Customer Segments
Subgroups of customers within each customer type. For example:
- If your customer type is "users," your segment might be "stay-at-home parents"
- If your customer type is "funders," your segment might be "impact investors"

## Key Principles

1. **Essential Only**: Only include customer types and segments you need to make your business model work
2. **Color Coding**: Use different colors or numbers for multiple customer types on your canvas
3. **Corresponding Elements**: Each customer type requires its own jobs-to-be-done and unique value proposition
4. **Overlap with Impact Model**: Some participants from your impact model may also be customers if you need to move them for your business model to succeed

## Usage Criteria
Apply this tag to content that:
- Defines customer types vs. customer segments
- Provides guidance on customer identification
- Discusses customer categorization methodologies
- Analyzes customer definitions in case studies

## Always Include When
- Content focuses on customer identification and definition
- Customer segmentation methodologies
- Customer type categorization approaches
- Customer analysis in examples

## Never Include When
- Content is about early adopters specifically (use `early-adopters` instead)
- General marketing or sales content not tied to canvas framework
- Customer service content unrelated to customer definition

## Required Combinations
- Must include appropriate canvas-sections hierarchy: [customer-model, customers]
- Often combined with `early-adopters` when content covers both

## Content Examples
- Customer identification frameworks
- Customer type vs. segment distinctions
- Customer definition templates
- Customer analysis methodologies

## Related Tags
- Parent tags: [customer-model](../customer-model.md)
- Child tag: [early-adopters](early-adopters/early-adopters.md)
- Often appears with [jobs-to-be-done](../jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done.md) (customers and their jobs)
- May combine with `case-study` content tags for customer analysis examples

## Hierarchy
- [Early Adopters](early-adopters/early-adopters.md) - Specific subset of customers for initial validation

## Key Concepts
- Customer Types: Broad roles (users, buyers, funders)
- Customer Segments: Specific subgroups within types
- Multi-sided markets: Different customer types
- Customer/user/payer distinctions
