# Economic Model

The Economic Model clarifies how customer value creation translates into a financially sustainable operation. It ensures the enterprise can maintain and scale its impact through viable economics.

## Purpose

The economic model answers the critical question: "How will this enterprise sustain itself financially while delivering impact?" It bridges the gap between creating value for customers and generating the resources needed to continue operations.

## Components

### [Channels](channels/channels.md)
Mechanisms to scale customer acquisition (marketing channels) and product/service distribution (distribution channels).

### [Revenue](revenue/revenue.md)
Regular income sources at scale (sales, donations, grants, sponsorship).

### [Costs](costs/costs.md)
Major ongoing expenses necessary to deliver the solution and achieve impact.

### [Advantage](advantage/advantage.md)
The specific strategic strengths or leverage points enabling financial viability and long-term success.

### [Financial Model](financial-model/financial-model.md)
Overview of key revenue streams and major costs, demonstrating sustainability at scale.

## How to create your economic model

Once you've developed the first version of your customer and impact models, it's time to lay out your economic model. Your economic model shows how your enterprise will take the value you create for your customers and turn it into an engine that will power the social value that's created by your impact model.

Where your customer and impact models drilled in on the micro of understanding how you create value and change starting with individuals, your impact model will focus on scale. Now scale doesn't necessarily mean that your enterprise needs to become huge, sometimes small is the right size for achieving your goals, but rather it's about understanding the dynamics by which your enterprise is going to operate at the size it needs to get to to achieve your goals.

Your economic model is going to unpack firstly how you're going to reach your customers at the scale you need, secondly how your financial model will work to ensure that you're financially sustainable and if it's one of your goals profitable, and thirdly it's going to be where you identify the key points of leverage that your business model is going to take advantage of in order for you to succeed.

These components all need to hold together in a coherent model, your economic model, that you and your supporters can understand and have confidence in.

### Key Considerations

- **Sustainability**: Can the model support ongoing operations?
- **Scalability**: Will unit economics improve or worsen with growth?
- **Diversification**: Are revenue sources resilient and diverse?
- **Impact Alignment**: Do economic incentives support or conflict with impact goals?
