## P2P FRAMING

**[MAIN PANEL: Empty Purpose box on canvas]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
Making a purpose pivot into building your own venture isn't easy. When things get tough—and they will—you'll doubt yourself and doubt your idea. Or worse, you'll push ahead in the wrong direction if you're not anchored to something solid.

Engaging your purpose gives you a foundation. It supports you through the venture building journey. And it helps you communicate clearly to others—to collaborators, customers, investors—why this matters, why they should engage with what you're doing.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Foundation | Communication | Alignment]**

Purpose keeps you aligned when things get tough. It makes your marketing clear and compelling. And when you put purpose into your work, you get to be a fuller version of yourself. Who wants to go thorough the difficulty of pivoting to building their own venture, if it didn't allow them to more fully embody there values, passion and vision in the world

**Tag line:** **Purpose anchors you.**

**[MAIN PANEL: Spectrum graphic - Personal → Values → Impact]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework showed you how to craft your purpose statement. Now let's talk about what purpose means for you, when you are building a p2p venture. 

**Tag line:** **Purpose has range.**

---

### The Purpose Spectrum

You may be deep in the social enterprise space and developing a detailed impact model. Full theory of change, measurable outcomes, the whole thing.

Or your purpose might be building something that can reliably feed your family and allow you to contribute to your community. Creating a better life for the people close to you.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Feed family → Core values → Full impact model]**

Or you're somewhere in between

All of this is valid. The key is being clear about it.

**Tag line:** **All purpose is valid.**

### Why This Matters for Purpose Pivot Ventures

**[MAIN PANEL: Why this Matters for P2P Ventures]**

When you pivot to building your own thing, you get to fold more of yourself into it.

You're not spending the most productive years of your life working on things that don't matter to you—essentially making shareholders rich. You get to decide what matters.

When you put more of yourself into your venture, it gets more of your energy, inspiration, sweat, and love. You become a fuller, more integrated version of yourself and your venture benefits from this.

**[VISUAL TEXT: More of you → More energy]**

**Tag line:** **Bring your whole self.**

---

### Design is Never Neutral

**[MAIN PANEL: Simple diagram showing system → defaults → unintended outcomes]**

**Script (spoken):**

There's also a deeper design reason to integrate purpose into your venture. Most business ignore this, and it's a large reason the world is in the sorry state it's in today.

Design is never neutral.

Systems always encode values. If you don't explicitly design for a value, a combination of defaults, constraints, and incentives will work against that value.

**[VISUAL TEXT: No explicit design for X | System evolves against X]**

Much of the harm in the world isn't intentional. It's systems that weren't deliberately designed to protect the things we value. What they were designed to achieve—growth and profit—caused them to evolve in ways that are destructive to things we value, in society and in the environment. 

Twentieth-century businesses created massive environmental destruction. Not because they set out harm the environment. But because they didn't set out explicitly intending not harm the environment. The incentives around what they did intend to do—grow the business and make money for shareholders—caused them to make thousands of small decisions that resulted in environmental destruction. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Optimize for A | Destroy unstated B]**

This is why a slogan like "Don't be Evil" doesn't stop a complex system like a modern corporation from producing destructive outcomes. You need to consciously decide what values and outcomes to prioritize alongside growth and profit. And then actively design to ensure that those outcomes are produced.

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Honest Hustle"]**

This is why internet hustle culture feels so icky. It prioritizes personal success and nothing else, which really means it prioritized personal success at the expense of everything else.

Honest Hustle is about bringing energy, tenacity, hard work and smart thinking—but also knowing what we stand for. And not compromising on this. Not accidentally hurting people or our planet because we never considered that this might be a consequence of our actions. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Energy + tenacity + values]**

So even if your purpose isn't about an explicit social or environmental mission, you still need to understand what you stand for. What matters to you. And how you want to be in the world as you build your venture.

Your purpose will shape every decision you make. When things get hard, it'll make sure you stand firm on what's important and find a way to succeed without selling your soul.

**Tag line:** **Design with values.**

### Examples Across the Spectrum

**[MAIN PANEL: Example library preview showing different ventures]**

Want to see what purpose looks like at different points on the spectrum? Look in the P2P Example Library.

- Ness Labs has a clear educational and community mission.
- Ridwell built itself around local environmental impact.
- DesignJoy focused on creative freedom and quality work. 

Different expressions of purpose—all legitimate.

The Core Example Library shows purpose-driven ventures across even wider range, including many social enterprises with comprehensive impact models.

### Practical Steps
**[VISUAL TEXT: Practical Steps]**

**[MAIN PANEL: Purpose box on canvas]**

Here's how to capture this:

If you're working with others, discuss your purpose and make sure you're aligned. Get on the same page early.

Keep it simple and powerful. Create a high-level description of why this matters. Capture that in your canvas along with any brief explanation that helps people understand.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Simple tagline | Brief explanation | Keep it clear]**

Details develop later in the Impact Model section. For the Purpose box, stay simple.

**Tag line:** **Simple and powerful.**

### Document Your Purpose

**[MAIN PANEL: Canvas with Purpose filled in]**

Document your purpose. Capture it in your canvas.

This becomes your north star. The thing you come back to when you're doubting, when decisions get hard, when you need to remember why you're doing this.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Making a purpose pivot into building
your own venture isn't easy.

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,301
When things get tough and they will get
tough, you'll doubt yourself or you'll

3
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:12,351
doubt your ideas, or worse, you'll
push ahead in the wrong direction.

4
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:15,835
If you're not anchored to
something solid, engaging your

5
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:17,890
purpose gives you a foundation.

6
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:21,865
It supports you through the venture
building journey, and it helps you

7
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:27,175
communicate to others, to collaborators,
customers, investors, why this matters,

8
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:30,715
why they should engage with what
you're doing and back you to do it.

9
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,671
Purpose keeps you aligned.

10
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:33,661
When things get tough.

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,663
It makes your marketing clear and
compelling, when you put purpose

12
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:41,056
into your work, you get to be
a fuller version of yourself.

13
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:44,677
Who wants to go through the difficulty
of pivoting to building their own

14
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:48,823
venture if it doesn't allow them
to more fully embody their values,

15
00:00:48,823 --> 00:00:50,233
passion and vision in the world.

16
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:54,831
Next, you'll work through
the core content on purpose.

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,310
After that, we'll come back and
talk about what purpose means

18
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,562
specifically for P two P ventures.




p2p 3.2.1 purpose 2.webm.02.mp4.webm
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,508
The core framework showed you how
to craft your purpose statement.

2
00:00:04,018 --> 00:00:07,078
Now let's talk about what
purpose means for you when you're

3
00:00:07,078 --> 00:00:08,698
building a P two P venture.

4
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:14,931
You may be deep in the social enterprise
space and developing a detailed impact

5
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:20,311
model, a full theory of change, measurable
outcomes, the whole thing, or your purpose

6
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:24,381
might be building something that can
reliably feed your family and allow you

7
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:28,281
to contribute to your community, creating
a better life for you and the people

8
00:00:28,281 --> 00:00:30,850
close to you, or somewhere in between.

9
00:00:31,313 --> 00:00:36,203
When you pivot to building your own thing,
you get to fold more of yourself into it.

10
00:00:37,013 --> 00:00:39,923
You're no longer spending the
most productive years of your life

11
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:43,553
working on things that don't matter
to you, making other people rich.

12
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:45,458
You get to decide what matters.

13
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:49,538
When you put more of yourself into
your venture, it gets more of your

14
00:00:49,538 --> 00:00:52,238
energy, inspiration, sweat and love.

15
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:56,101
You become a fuller, more
integrated version of yourself and

16
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:57,901
your venture benefits from this.

17
00:00:58,672 --> 00:01:02,242
There's also a deeper design reason to
integrate purpose into your venture.

18
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:07,042
Most businesses ignore this, and
it's a large reason why the world is

19
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:08,932
in the sorry state it is in today.

20
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:10,996
Design is never neutral.

21
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:13,591
Systems always encode values.

22
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:17,661
If you don't explicitly design
for a value, a combination of

23
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:22,236
defaults, constraints and incentives
will work against that value.

24
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:25,381
Much of the harm in the world
today is not intentional.

25
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:29,919
It's systems that weren't deliberately
designed to protect the things that we

26
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:32,488
value, what they were designed to achieve.

27
00:01:32,518 --> 00:01:37,348
Growth and profit cause them to
evolve in ways that are destructive

28
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:40,528
to things that we value in
society and in the environment.

29
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:40,618
Okay.

30
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:45,810
20th century businesses created massive
environmental destruction, not because

31
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,510
they set out to harm the environment, but
because they didn't set out explicitly

32
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,495
intending not to harm the environment.

33
00:01:53,434 --> 00:01:57,814
The incentives around what they did
intend to do, grow the business and

34
00:01:57,814 --> 00:02:02,044
make money for shareholders, caused
them to make thousands of small

35
00:02:02,044 --> 00:02:06,327
decisions that resulted collectively
in environmental destruction.

36
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:12,612
This is why a slogan like Don't Be
Evil doesn't stop complex systems

37
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:16,042
like modern corporations from
producing destructive outcomes.

38
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:21,488
You need to consciously decide what
values and outcomes to prioritize

39
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:26,152
alongside growth and profit, then
actively designed to ensure that

40
00:02:26,152 --> 00:02:28,042
those outcomes are prioritized.

41
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:31,549
This is why Internet hustle
culture feels so icky.

42
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:36,775
It prioritizes personal success and
nothing else, which really means

43
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:41,185
prioritizing personal success at
the expense of everything else.

44
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,415
Honest Hustle is about bringing
energy, tenacity, hard work, and smart

45
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:52,141
thinking, but also knowing what we stand
for and not compromising on this not

46
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:54,421
accidentally hurting people or our planet.

47
00:02:54,436 --> 00:02:58,215
Because we never considered that
an action may have a consequence.

48
00:02:58,903 --> 00:03:03,036
So even if your purpose isn't about
an explicit social or environmental

49
00:03:03,036 --> 00:03:07,540
mission, you still need to understand
what you stand for, what matters to

50
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,871
you, and how you want to be in the
world as you build your venture.

51
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:15,559
Your purpose will shape every decision
you make when things get hard.

52
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:20,247
It'll make sure that you stand firm on
what's important to you and find a way

53
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:22,317
to succeed without selling your soul.

54
00:03:23,058 --> 00:03:26,118
Let's take a look at what purpose
looks like at different points

55
00:03:26,178 --> 00:03:27,708
across the purpose spectrum.

56
00:03:28,106 --> 00:03:32,966
Looking in the P two P example library,
you can see that Nest Labs has a clear

57
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:34,736
educational and community mission.

58
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:40,176
Red well built itself around
local environmental impact design.

59
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:44,927
Joy focused on creative freedom and
quality work, different expressions

60
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:46,607
of purpose, all legitimate.

61
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:50,798
The core example library shows
purpose-driven ventures across

62
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:54,428
an even wider range, including
many social enterprises with

63
00:03:54,428 --> 00:03:56,138
comprehensive impact models.

64
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:58,399
how to capture this.

65
00:03:58,501 --> 00:04:01,261
If you're working with others,
discuss your purpose and

66
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:02,641
make sure you're all aligned.

67
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:04,411
Get on the same page early.

68
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:06,322
Keep it simple and powerful.

69
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:09,292
Create a high level description
of why this matters.

70
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,461
Capture that in your canvas
along with any brief explanation

71
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,991
that helps people understand it.

72
00:04:16,054 --> 00:04:18,694
Document your purpose,
capture it in your canvas.

73
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:20,434
This becomes your north star.

74
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:24,081
The thing that you come back to
when you're doubting, when decisions

75
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:27,260
get hard and when you need to
remember why you're doing this.
