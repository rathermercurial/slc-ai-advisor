### Key Metrics: Tracking Your Progress

<span style="color:red">clap</span> 

Now let's talk about how you track progress through your strategy.

`[MAIN PANEL: Key Metrics box on canvas]`

Your key metrics correspond to what you're validating at each stage. They show whether your experiments are succeeding, whether you're learning what you need to learn, and whether you're moving forward.

### What to Track When

Early stage validation metrics are different from later stage execution metrics.

**0-2 Months: Discovery Phase**

In the discovery phase, Toast Ale tracks activity metrics. Did they complete twenty-five customer interviews? Did they engage ten bakeries in conversations? Did they run five taste test sessions? Are they documenting the key insights they're learning?

These metrics show whether they're doing the discovery work they planned. Are they generating the insights they need to move forward?

**2-6 Months: Proof Phase**

In the proof phase, the metrics shift to validation. What's the shelf-to-purchase conversion rate? They're targeting fifteen percent. What's their customer acquisition cost through bottle shops? They want it under three dollars per customer. How much bread are they collecting from bakeries? They're targeting five hundred kilograms over three months. What emissions are they avoiding based on the bread they've diverted?

These metrics prove whether their assumptions hold up at scale. They're not tracking activities anymore - they're tracking whether the model works.

**6-18 Months: Scale Phase**

In the scale phase, metrics become more about execution. What's their monthly production volume and revenue? What's their gross margin per bottle - they need forty percent or better to make the economics work. What's the customer retention rate - are thirty percent of customers repurchasing within three months? What's their cumulative environmental impact - total bread diverted, total emissions avoided?

These are business performance metrics now. They're measuring whether the business model is working at scale.

`[VISUAL TEXT: early = activities | mid = validation | later = execution]`

Your metrics evolve as you progress through your strategy. Each phase needs different measurements because you're answering different questions.

### Ratios vs Hard Numbers

Use ratios, not just hard numbers, because ratios give you scalable insights.

**Hard number:** "We sold 500 bottles" - Okay, but what does that mean?

**Ratio:** "15% shelf-to-purchase conversion rate" - Now you can predict what happens when you're in 50 shops instead of 10.

**Hard number:** "We got 25 referrals" - Is that good?

**Ratio:** "10% referral rate from paying customers" - Now you know: for every 100 customers, you get 10 referrals. That's predictive power.

Toast Ale might use ratios throughout:

- Conversion rate (activation to purchase)
- Customer acquisition cost (dollars per customer)
- Retention rate (percentage who repurchase)
- Bread diversion efficiency (kg collected per bakery per week)

These ratios let them model what happens at scale.

### Avoiding Vanity Metrics

Vanity metrics feel good but don't show learning. They make you feel like you're making progress when you might not be.

**Vanity:** "Total bottles sold" - Could be driven by you buying your own product or friends pity-buying.

**Real:** "Conversion rate from retail shelf to purchase" - Shows actual customer demand.

**Vanity:** "Total social media followers" - Means nothing if they don't buy.

**Real:** "Customer acquisition cost through social media" - Shows if social media is an effective channel.

**Vanity:** "Total bread collected" - Sounds impressive but doesn't show efficiency.

**Real:** "Cost per kilogram of bread diverted" - Shows if the impact model economics work.

`[VISUAL TEXT: vanity = feels good | real = proves assumptions]`

Choose metrics that prove or disprove your assumptions. That's what moves you forward.

### Your Strategy Model as a Living Document

Your strategy model is not something you create once and never touch again. It's a living document that evolves as you learn.

Set regular review cycles. Maybe monthly in your early stages when things are changing fast. Quarterly once you're in execution mode.

In each review, ask:

What did we learn from our validation experiments?

What assumptions were proven? What were disproven?

Does our strategy need to change based on what we learned?

`[MAIN PANEL: Strategy review cycle diagram]`

When validation invalidates assumptions - and it will - revise your strategy.

For Toast Ale, imagine after two months of customer discovery they learned that bottle shops aren't actually the right channel. Craft beer drinkers who care about sustainability shop mostly online and at farmers markets.

This invalidates their 2-6 month plan. The bottle shop pilot won't work.

So they revise: Instead of bottle shops, they plan an online sales pilot and farmers market presence. This changes their organizational layer (need e-commerce capability, not retail relationships). Might change their capital layer (different infrastructure costs).

`[VISUAL TEXT: learn → revise → execute → learn]`

The strategy model makes this revision process clean. You can see the ripple effects across all three layers and adjust accordingly.

This is how you navigate uncertainty. Not by predicting perfectly, but by planning flexibly and revising as you learn.

### Stage-Appropriate Strategy

Your strategy will look different depending on what stage you're at.

`[MAIN PANEL: Venture Stage Map reference]`

**Idea Stage** - Mostly experiments, minimal organizational structure, usually bootstrapped. Your strategy is primarily about discovery .

**Early Stage** - Mix of validation and execution, building organizational capacity, possibly first external capital. Your strategy balances proving and building.

**Growth Stage** - Validating that the model will work at scale, raising capital for growth if needed. Your strategy focuses on growing into a business that can succeed

**Scale Stage** - Optimizing and improving, investing in scale, professional management. Strategic partnerships. Your strategy focuses on sustained delivery of your economics and impact at scale

Toast Ale starts at idea stage across all dimensions. Their strategy reflects this - discovery-heavy early on, building toward early stage through validation.

Your strategy should match your stage. Don't try to build growth stage infrastructure when you're at idea stage. And don't stay in perpetual validation mode when you're ready to execute.

### Creating Your Strategy Model: A Working Session

This is substantial work. Don't rush it.

Set aside dedicated time - maybe a weekend - to work through this properly. If you have a team, do it together. If you have advisors, involve them in reviewing your thinking.

But remember: You hold the systems view. Advisors see through the lens of their expertise. You see how all the pieces fit together.

Use advisors for input and challenge. Don't outsource your thinking to them. This is your strategy. You need to own it.

`[VISUAL TEXT: dedicated time | involve team/advisors | you hold systems view]`


By the end, have a clear two-month plan, a solid six-month plan, and a directional eighteen-month plan. All three layers mapped and integrated.

When you have this, you are ready to execute
### Ready to Move Forward

You have a complete strategy model when you can answer these questions:

Do you have a clear, detailed two-month plan?

Have you mapped a logical six-month plan based on your validation experiments succeeding?

Do you have an aspirational eighteen-month plan showing your longer arc?

Have you built all three layers - business model, organizational, and capital?

Do the layers work together, with each enabling the others?

Have you identified your key metrics for tracking progress at each stage?

`[VISUAL TEXT: 2/6/18 plans clear | three layers integrated | metrics defined]`

If yes, you have a strategy. You know what you're doing next and why. You have a roadmap from where you are now to where you're heading.

Time to wrap this up and start to execute the strategy.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,939
Now let's talk about how to track
progress through your strategy.

2
00:00:03,617 --> 00:00:06,667
Your key metrics correspond
to what you are validating.

3
00:00:06,697 --> 00:00:10,956
At each stage, they show whether your
experiments are succeeding, whether you

4
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:14,166
are learning what you need to learn,
and whether you're moving forward.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,910
Early stage validation metrics
are different from later

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,650
stage execution metrics.

7
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:23,696
In the discovery phase, tota
tracks activity metrics.

8
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:26,504
Did they complete 25 customer interviews?

9
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:28,894
Did they engage 10
bakeries in conversations?

10
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,679
Did they run five taste test sessions?

11
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,163
Are they documenting the key
insights that they've learned?

12
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:38,561
These metrics show whether they're doing
the discovery work that they planned.

13
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:42,924
Are they generating the insights they
need to move forward When they start

14
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:47,353
to do quantitative validation, the
metrics shift    things like, what's

15
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:49,513
the shelf to purchase conversion rate?

16
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,180
They're targeting 15%.

17
00:00:51,506 --> 00:00:53,576
What's their customer acquisition cost?

18
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:54,686
Through bottle shops.

19
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:56,774
They want it under one pound per customer.

20
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,916
How much bread are they
collecting from bakeries?

21
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:02,713
They're targeting 500
kilograms over three months.

22
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:05,986
What emissions are they avoiding
based on the bread that they've diver?

23
00:01:06,944 --> 00:01:10,300
These metrics prove whether their
assumptions hold up at scale.

24
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:12,511
They're not tracking activities anymore.

25
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:16,573
They're tracking whether the model
works in the growth and scale phase.

26
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:18,816
Metrics become more about execution.

27
00:01:19,068 --> 00:01:20,538
What's their monthly production?

28
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,588
Volume and revenue?

29
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,411
What's their gross margin per bottle?

30
00:01:23,931 --> 00:01:26,990
They need 40% or better to
make their economics work.

31
00:01:27,323 --> 00:01:29,023
What's the customer retention rate?

32
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:32,646
Are 30% of customers
repurchasing within three months?

33
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:35,154
What's their weekly environmental impact?

34
00:01:35,408 --> 00:01:39,124
Weekly bread diverted, weekly
emissions avoided These are

35
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:40,534
business performance metrics.

36
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,963
Now they're measuring whether the
business model is working at scale.

37
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,048
Your metrics evolve as you
progress through your strategy.

38
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,668
Each phase needs different measurements
you are answering different questions.

39
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:59,071
Use ratios not just hard numbers because
ratios give you scalable insights.

40
00:01:59,462 --> 00:02:02,282
A hard number might be
we sold 500 bottles.

41
00:02:02,561 --> 00:02:04,181
Okay, but what does that mean?

42
00:02:04,445 --> 00:02:08,639
A ratio might be 15% shelf
to purchase conversion rate.

43
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:13,309
Now you can predict what happens when
you are in 50 shops instead of 10.

44
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:16,876
A hard number might be,
we got 25 referrals.

45
00:02:16,876 --> 00:02:17,566
Is that good?

46
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:21,852
A ratio might be 10% referral
rate from paying customers.

47
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:25,484
Now, you know, for every a hundred
customers you get 10 referrals.

48
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:27,002
That's predictive power.

49
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:31,602
To Stale might use ratios throughout
conversion rate activation to

50
00:02:31,602 --> 00:02:33,540
purchase customer acquisition.

51
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,974
Cost dollars per customer
Retention rate percentage Who

52
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:38,847
repurchased Bread diversion.

53
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:39,507
Efficiency.

54
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:41,756
Kilograms collected per bakery per week.

55
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:45,553
These ratios, let them model
what will happen at scale.

56
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:49,073
Vanity metrics feel good,
but don't show learning.

57
00:02:49,195 --> 00:02:52,284
and they can make you feel like you're
making progress when you might not be.

58
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,369
A vanity metric might
be total bottles sold.

59
00:02:55,702 --> 00:02:59,152
It could be driven by you buying
your own product or friends pity.

60
00:02:59,152 --> 00:03:03,112
Buying A real metric might
be the conversion rate from

61
00:03:03,112 --> 00:03:06,972
retail shelf to purchase, which
shows actual customer demand.

62
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:10,471
A vanity metric might be
total social media followers.

63
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:12,387
It means nothing if they're not buying.

64
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:15,667
A real metric might be
customer acquisition cost

65
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:17,521
through social media shows.

66
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:20,371
If social media is actually
an effective channel.

67
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:23,987
Choose metrics that prove or
disprove your assumptions.

68
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:25,801
That's what moves you forward.

69
00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:30,935
Your strategy model is not something that
you create once and never touch again.

70
00:03:31,172 --> 00:03:34,936
It's a living document that evolves
as you learn, Set regular review

71
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:39,062
cycles, maybe weekly in your early
stages when things are changing fast.

72
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,500
and then monthly once
you're in execution mode.

73
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:45,760
In each review ask what did we learn
from our validation experiments?

74
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:47,576
What assumptions were proven?

75
00:03:47,696 --> 00:03:48,686
What were disproven?

76
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:51,951
Does our strategy need to change
based on what we've learned?

77
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:58,137
when validation, invalidates assumptions
and it will revise your strategy for tota.

78
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:01,943
Imagine after two months of customer
discovery, they learn that bottle shops

79
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:02,843
aren't actually the right channel.

80
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:07,173
Craft beer drinkers who care
about sustainability, shop mostly

81
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:09,063
online or at farmer's markets.

82
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:11,158
This invalidates their
two to six month plan.

83
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:13,728
The bottle shop pilot won't work.

84
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:15,196
So they revise.

85
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:18,226
Instead of bottle shops, they
plan an online sales pilot

86
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:20,009
and farmer's market presence.

87
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:22,746
This changes their organizational layer.

88
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:26,466
They need e-commerce capability,
not retail relationships.

89
00:04:26,763 --> 00:04:28,316
It might change their capital layer.

90
00:04:28,556 --> 00:04:30,956
They need different infrastructure,
which has different costs.

91
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,717
The strategy model makes
the revision process clean.

92
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:39,044
You can see the ripple effects across
all three layers and adjust accordingly.

93
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:44,366
This is how you navigate uncertainty, not
by predicting perfectly, but by planning

94
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:46,586
flexibly and revising as you learn.

95
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:50,991
Your strategy will look different
depending on what stage you're at.

96
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,259
Idea stage will be mostly experiments.

97
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:57,229
Minimal organizational
structure, usually bootstrapped.

98
00:04:57,468 --> 00:05:00,087
Your strategy is primarily
about  validation.

99
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:04,057
Early stage will be a mix
of validation and execution.

100
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:08,402
Building organizational capacity,
possibly first external capital.

101
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:12,196
Your strategy balances proving
and building Growth stage.

102
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:14,506
Validating that the
model will work at scale.

103
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:16,645
Raising capital for your growth if needed.

104
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:20,365
Your strategy focuses on growing
into a business that can succeed.

105
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:21,960
and finally scale.

106
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,426
Stage.

107
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:25,968
Optimizing and improving,
investing in scale, professional

108
00:05:25,968 --> 00:05:28,282
management, strategic partnerships.

109
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:31,312
Your strategy focuses on
sustained delivery of your

110
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:33,382
economics and impact at scale.

111
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:36,923
Tota starts at idea stage
across all dimensions.

112
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:41,496
Their strategy reflects this  Discovery
heavy early on, building towards

113
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:43,086
early stage through validation.

114
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:45,733
Your strategy should match your stage.

115
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:50,019
Don't try to build growth stage
infrastructure when you're at idea stage.

116
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:53,823
And don't stay in perpetual validation
mode when you're ready to execute.

117
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:56,414
this is important work.

118
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:57,284
Don't rush it.

119
00:05:57,593 --> 00:06:01,515
Set aside dedicated time, maybe a
weekend to work through this properly.

120
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:03,903
If you have a team, do it together.

121
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:07,942
If you have advisors, involve
them in reviewing your thinking.

122
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:10,739
But remember, you hold the systems.

123
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:14,300
View  Advisors see through
the lens of their expertise.

124
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:16,338
You see how all the pieces fit together.

125
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:19,011
Use advisors for input and challenge.

126
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,060
Don't outsource your
thinking to them though.

127
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:22,583
This is your strategy.

128
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:23,813
You need to own it

129
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:25,542
By the end.

130
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:28,902
Have a clear two month plan,
a solid six month plan, and

131
00:06:28,902 --> 00:06:30,702
a directional 18 month plan.

132
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:33,572
All three layers mapped
out and integrated.

133
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:36,725
When you have this,
you're ready to execute.
