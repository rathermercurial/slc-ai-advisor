## Section 5.1.6: Validating Your Economic Model

**Tag line: "Prove the economics work"**

### Economic Model Powered by Customer Model

Now you have a plan to validate your customer model and your impact model, you need to figure out how you are going to validate your economic model.

`[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas - highlight Economic Model section]`

Your economic model is powered by your customer model. Your customer model creates value for customers. Your economic model delivers that value through channels, captures it through revenue, and manages the costs of doing this while also delivering your impact.

Here's the important point: Customer validation already started proving your economics.

### Building on Your Module 4 Work

In Module 4, you worked through improving your economic model. You calculated unit economics and breakeven. You figured out TAM times ARPU. You mapped your channels and identified how you'd capture revenue and manage costs.

And you identified the riskiest assumptions in your economic model.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Module 4 = unit economics | Module 5 = prove at scale]`

Now you're going to validate those assumptions. You're going to prove your economic model works at the scale you need.

### What Customer Validation Already Proved

Before diving into economic model validation, recognize what you will have already learned.

Your customer interviews will reveal pricing sensitivity. They'll tell you what people are willing to pay. That's revenue validation starting.

Your customer discovery tests channels too. They'll tell you where your early adopters hang out and how to reach them. That's channel validation starting.

Your early experiments - prototypes, pilots, small sales - will show that people will actually pay for your solution. That's proof your revenue model can work.

`[VISUAL TEXT: pricing tested | channels identified | willingness to pay proven]`

Economic validation builds on this foundation to prove that it works at scale.

### What to Validate: Walking Through Economic Components

You need to validate assumptions across all components of your economic model.  

`[MAIN PANEL: Economic Model section with components highlighted]`

You will not validate them all at once. But you do need to work through them systematically to be able to understand where the high priorities assumptions are. 

**Channels** - Can you reach customers at scale through these channels? What's your customer acquisition cost? What are the conversion rates at each stage? Do the channels work the way you predicted?

**Revenue** - Will customers pay the price you need? Is your ARPU calculation accurate? What are your retention rates? Do people come back and pay again?

**Costs** - Are your cost assumptions correct? What are your actual costs of goods sold? Your fixed costs? Your distribution costs?

And critically - if your impact model activities are separate from delivering your core product or service, what do those impact activities actually cost?

This is essential - you can't know if your overall economic model works without knowing your true cost structure, including impact delivery costs.

**Advantage** - Do your leverage points actually work as predicted? We'll come back to this.

`[VISUAL TEXT: channels | revenue | costs (including impact) | advantage]`

Often you'll validate these components together through integrated experiments. But let's look at each one.

### Toast Ale: Economic Components Validation

For our hypothetical Toast Ale founders, here's what they need to validate in each component:

**Channels**

They need to prove bottle shops work as a distribution channel at scale. Their customer discovery showed early adopters shop at craft beer stores. But can they get their beer into enough shops? What does distribution cost? What's the conversion rate from "sees it on shelf" to "buys it"?

Their bottle shop pilot with five hundred bottles across ten shops tests this. They're measuring how quickly beer moves, what shelf placement works, what the actual cost per bottle is to get it into shops.

**Revenue**

They need to prove people will pay 3 pounds per bottle at scale, not just in friendly tastings. They need to test whether ARPU holds up across different customer segments. Will people buy one bottle or multiple? Will they come back?

The pilot measures actual sales. Real money exchanged. No friendly discounts. This proves revenue assumptions.

**Costs**

They need to validate their cost structure across multiple areas:

Production costs - Can they brew at the cost they predicted? Does using surplus bread actually reduce malt costs enough to matter?

Distribution costs - What does it really cost to get beer into bottle shops and keep it stocked?

Impact model costs - This is critical. Can they collect surplus bread from bakeries at the cost they estimated? What are the logistics costs? How much do they need to donate to charities to deliver their impact model? 

`[MAIN PANEL: Toast Ale cost structure breakdown]`

Without validating these impact activity costs, they can't know if their overall economics work. The bread collection and charity funding are part of their cost structure and need to be proven.

**Advantage**

Toast Ale believes their sustainability mission creates an advantage - that the environmental story will drive sales above what a regular craft beer could expect. Does this actually work?

The pilot tests this. Are people willing to pay a premium? Does the mission-aligned positioning increase conversion rates? Is word-of-mouth stronger than for comparable beers without the mission angle?

### AARRR Framework as Validation Tool

The Pirate Metrics framework - AARRR - gives you a useful lens for designing economic validation experiments.

`[MAIN PANEL: AARRR funnel diagram]`

**Acquisition** - How many potential customers become aware of your product?

**Activation** - How many engage with it?

**Revenue** - How many pay?

**Retention** - How many come back and pay again?

**Referral** - How many tell others?

`[VISUAL TEXT: Acquisition → Activation → Revenue → Retention → Referral]`

For Toast Ale's bottle shop pilot, they're testing the entire funnel:

Acquisition - How many people see the beer on the shelf?

Activation - How many pick it up and read the label?

Revenue - How many buy it?

Retention - How many come back to buy more?

Referral - How many tell friends or ask retailers to keep stocking it?

This framework helps you design experiments that test your economic model systematically.

### MVP: Integrated Validation

Often the most efficient way to validate your economic model is through an MVP - a minimum viable product that tests multiple assumptions simultaneously.

Remember the three circles model from Section 3.1? Circle one is your MVP. Circle two is the version of your venture that can reach success. The MVP tests the core assumptions you need to prove to get from circle one to circle two.

`[MAIN PANEL: Three circles diagram with MVP and success highlighted]`

Toast Ale's bottle shop pilot is exactly this kind of MVP. It's not just validating economics - it's validating customer, economic, and some impact assumptions all at once.

Customer assumptions - People will buy beer positioned as fighting food waste.

Economic assumptions - Channels work, pricing works, costs are manageable, conversion rates support the model.

Impact assumptions - Bread collection is feasible, waste is actually diverted.

`[VISUAL TEXT: MVP = customer + economic + impact validation]`

This integrated approach is efficient. One experiment validates multiple models simultaneously.

When you're designing your economic validation plan, look for these integrated MVP opportunities. Don't test everything separately if you can test multiple assumptions together.

### Advantage Validation

Different types of advantage need different validation approaches.

`[MAIN PANEL: Examples of advantage types]`

If your advantage is network effects, you need to test whether growth actually accelerates as you add users.

If it's economies of scale, you need to test whether unit costs actually decrease as volume increases.

If it's brand, you need to test whether brand awareness reduces customer acquisition costs or increases conversion rates.

If it's intellectual property, you need to test whether your IP creates defensibility that competitors can't replicate.

If it's mission alignment - like Toast Ale - you need to test whether your purpose-driven positioning actually drives sales above what you'd expect without it.

For Toast Ale, they're testing: Does the sustainability story create an advantage? They compare their conversion rates and word-of-mouth to similar craft beers without the environmental mission. If their rates are higher, the advantage is real.

### Designing Your Validation Plan

Now take your risky economic assumptions from Module 4 and design experiments to validate them.

For each assumption, ask:

What's the fastest, cheapest way to test this at scale?

Can I test multiple assumptions together through an integrated MVP?

What have I already validated through customer discovery?

What success criteria will prove this assumption correct?

`[VISUAL TEXT: fastest test | integrate MVPs | build on customer work | clear criteria]`

Balance single-assumption tests with integrated experiments. Sometimes you need to isolate one variable. Sometimes an MVP that tests everything together is smarter.

Remember that some costs are straightforward to model - like courier services or standard production costs. Focus your validation efforts on the uncertain costs, especially your impact model delivery costs if those are significant.

**Create a validation plan document.** List your experiments in priority order, starting with the riskiest assumptions. For each experiment, document:

- What assumption(s) it tests
- How you'll run it (method, participants, scale)
- Success criteria (what proves it right or wrong)
- Timeline and resources needed



This plan becomes your input for building your strategy model 

Once this is complete, it's time to build your strategy. 

1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,661
Now you have a plan to validate your
customer model and your impact model.

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,721
You need to figure out how you're
gonna validate your economic model.

3
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:10,509
Your economic model is powered
by your customer model.

4
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:14,627
Your customer model creates value for
customers, your economic model delivers

5
00:00:14,627 --> 00:00:18,199
that value through its channels,
captures it through revenue, and

6
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,399
manages the costs of doing so while
also funding delivering your impact.

7
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,667
customer validation will have
already started to validate

8
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:26,777
some of your economics.

9
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:30,923
In the previous module, you worked
through improving your economic model.

10
00:00:31,195 --> 00:00:33,985
You calculated unit
economics and breakeven.

11
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,062
You figured out TAM times, arpu.

12
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:40,193
You mapped your channels and identified
how you'd capture revenue and managed

13
00:00:40,193 --> 00:00:44,221
costs, and you identified the riskiest
assumptions in your economic model.

14
00:00:44,887 --> 00:00:47,047
Now you're gonna validate
those assumptions.

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,230
You're gonna prove that your economic
model works at the scale you need it to

16
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:56,001
Before we dive in, let's cover off
what you will have already learned.

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,650
Your customer interviews will
have revealed pricing sensitivity.

18
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:02,371
They'll have told you what
people are willing to pay.

19
00:01:02,478 --> 00:01:03,888
That's revenue validation starting.

20
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:07,354
Your customer discovery
tests channels as well.

21
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:11,378
They'll tell you where your early adopters
hang out and how you might reach them.

22
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:15,487
That's channel validation starting
Early experiments you might have

23
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:18,523
done prototypes, pilots, small sales.

24
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:21,866
That's small scale validation
that your revenue model can work.

25
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:25,839
Your economic model validation
builds on this foundation to

26
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:27,519
prove that it will work at scale.

27
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:32,697
You need to validate assumptions across
all the components of your economic model.

28
00:01:33,205 --> 00:01:36,984
You probably won't validate them all at
once, but you do need to work through them

29
00:01:36,984 --> 00:01:41,240
systematically to be able to understand
where the high priority assumptions are.

30
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:42,954
starting with channels.

31
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:46,209
Can you reach customers at
scale through those channels?

32
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:48,563
What's your cost of customer acquisition?

33
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,320
What are the conversion
rates at each stage?

34
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:54,777
Do the channels work the
way you predicted revenue?

35
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:56,557
Will customers pay the price you need?

36
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,386
Is your ARPU calculated accurately?

37
00:01:59,675 --> 00:02:01,113
What are your retention rates?

38
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:03,130
Do people come back and pay again?

39
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,396
Costs are your cost
assumptions actually correct.

40
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:11,116
What are your actual costs of goods sold,
your fixed costs, your distribution costs,

41
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:15,133
And critically, if your impact model
activities are separate from delivering

42
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:19,444
your core product or service, what do
those impact activities actually cost you?

43
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:20,895
This is essential.

44
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:24,590
You can't know whether your overall
impact model works without knowing

45
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,379
your true cost structure, including
impact delivery costs Advantage.

46
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:32,423
Does business model leverage
work the way you predict it?

47
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:36,653
We'll come back to this Often you'll
validate these components together

48
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:39,917
through integrated experiments,
but let's look at each one.

49
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,756
For our hypothetical toast ale
founders, here's what they needed

50
00:02:43,756 --> 00:02:45,433
to validate in each component.

51
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:50,560
Channels They need to prove bottle shops
work as a distribution channel at scale.

52
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:54,807
Their customer discovery showed early
adopters shop at craft beer stores.

53
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:57,277
but can they get their
beer into enough shops?

54
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,972
What does distribution cost?

55
00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:00,590
What's the conversion rate from?

56
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,195
See it on a shelf to buy it.

57
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:07,484
Their bottle shop pilot with 500
bottles across 10 shops tests this.

58
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:11,685
They're measuring how quickly beer
moves, what shelf placement works,

59
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:16,076
what the actual cost per bottle to
get it onto the shelves is Revenue.

60
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:20,057
They need to prove people will pay
three pounds per bottle at scale,

61
00:03:20,237 --> 00:03:21,947
not just in friendly tastings.

62
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:26,567
they need to test whether ARPU holds up
Will people buy one bottle or multiple?

63
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:27,647
Will they come back?

64
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:30,066
The pilot measures actual sales.

65
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:31,536
Real money exchanged.

66
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:32,997
No friendly discounts.

67
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:35,059
This proves revenue assumptions.

68
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,168
They need to validate their cost
structure across multiple areas.

69
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:40,458
Production costs.

70
00:03:40,497 --> 00:03:42,777
Can they brew at the cost they predicted?

71
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:46,213
Does using surplus bread
actually reduce malt costs?

72
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:48,703
Enough to matter Distribution costs.

73
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:52,408
What does it really cost to get
beer into shops and keep it stopped?

74
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:54,263
Impact model costs.

75
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:55,446
This is critical.

76
00:03:55,504 --> 00:03:59,335
Can they collect surplus bread from
bakeries at the cost they estimated?

77
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,222
What are the logistics costs?

78
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:04,903
How much do they need to donate to
their charities to deliver their impact?

79
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:07,912
without validating these
impact activity costs.

80
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:10,612
they can't know if their
overall economics work.

81
00:04:10,994 --> 00:04:14,647
The bread collection and charity
funding are part of their cost structure

82
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:19,284
and need to be proven  advantage
Toile believes their sustainability

83
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:20,582
mission creates an advantage.

84
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,268
That their environmental story
will drive sales above what a

85
00:04:24,268 --> 00:04:26,038
regular craft beer could expect.

86
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:27,520
Does this actually work?

87
00:04:27,906 --> 00:04:29,256
The pilot tests this.

88
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,052
Are people willing to pay a premium?

89
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,537
Does the mission alignment
positioning increase conversion rates?

90
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:38,048
Is word of mouth stronger
than for comparable beers

91
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:39,276
without the mission angle?

How many tell friends or ask

106
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,769
This framework helps you design
experiments that test your

107
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:24,449
economic model systematically.

108
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,710
Often, the most efficient way to validate
your economic model is through an MVP,

109
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,182
A minimum viable product that tests
multiple assumptions simultaneously.

110
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:37,609
Remember the three circles
model from the earlier section.

111
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:41,815
Circle one is your MVP Circle
two is the version of your

112
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,416
venture that can reach success.

113
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:48,147
The MVP tests the core assumptions
that you need to get your circle

114
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,977
two success model to work.

115
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,842
Bottle shop pilot is
exactly this kind of MVP.

116
00:05:54,348 --> 00:05:58,998
It's not just validating economics,
it's validating customer economics and

117
00:05:58,998 --> 00:06:01,308
some impact assumptions all at once.

118
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:05,652
People will buy beer positioned
as fighting food waste.

119
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:08,319
Economic assumptions, channels work.

120
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,249
Pricing works.

121
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:10,419
Costs are manageable.

122
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:13,689
Conversion rates support the
model impact assumptions.

123
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:15,385
Breed collection is feasible.

124
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:16,855
Waste is actually diverted.

125
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,495
This integrated approach is efficient.

126
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:23,762
One experiment validates multiple
models simultaneously when you're

127
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,952
designing your economic validation plan.

128
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:28,942
Look for these integrated
MVP opportunities.

129
00:06:29,077 --> 00:06:30,848
Don't test everything separately.

130
00:06:30,878 --> 00:06:33,968
If you can test multiple
assumptions together efficiently,

131
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:38,516
different types of advantage need
different validation approaches.

132
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:43,513
If your advantage is network effects,
you need to test whether adding users

133
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:45,338
actually has the effect you want it to.

134
00:06:45,843 --> 00:06:50,253
If it's economies of scale, you need
to test where unit costs actually

135
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:52,383
decrease as volume increases.

136
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:56,305
If it's brand, you need to test
whether brand awareness reduces

137
00:06:56,305 --> 00:06:59,947
customer acquisition costs or
increases conversion rates.

138
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:05,038
If it's intellectual property, you need to
test whether your IP creates defensibility

139
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,770
that competitors can't replicate.

140
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:10,673
If it's mission alignment, like
to ale, you need to test whether

141
00:07:10,673 --> 00:07:14,423
your purpose-driven positioning
actually drives sales above what

142
00:07:14,423 --> 00:07:16,822
you'd expect without it for to ale.

143
00:07:16,822 --> 00:07:17,542
They're testing.

144
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:20,751
Does the sustainability
story create an advantage?

145
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:25,186
They compare their conversion rates and
word of mouth to similar craft beers

146
00:07:25,186 --> 00:07:26,716
without the environmental mission.

147
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:29,521
If their rates are higher,
the advantage is real.

148
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:34,749
Now take your risky economic assumptions
from the previous module and design

149
00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:36,309
experiments to validate them.

150
00:07:36,558 --> 00:07:39,648
For each assumption, ask,
what's the fastest, cheapest

151
00:07:39,648 --> 00:07:41,178
way to test this at scale?

152
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:45,124
Can I test multiple assumptions
together through an integrated MVP?

153
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:48,268
What have I already validated
through customer discovery?

154
00:07:48,562 --> 00:07:51,970
What success criteria will
prove this assumption, correct.

155
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,281
Balance single assumption tests
with integrated experiments.

156
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:58,798
Sometimes you need to
isolate one variable.

157
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,775
Sometimes an MVP that tests
everything  together is smarter.

158
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:06,575
Remember that some costs are
straightforward to model, like courier

159
00:08:06,575 --> 00:08:09,155
services or standard production costs.

160
00:08:09,386 --> 00:08:13,322
Focus your validation efforts
on uncertain costs, especially

161
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:15,212
your impact model delivery costs.

162
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,906
If those are significant,
create a validation plan.

163
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:21,936
List your experiments in
priority order, starting with

164
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:23,736
the riskiest assumptions first.

165
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,569
For each experiment document.

166
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,168
What assumptions it tests, how you run it.

167
00:08:28,318 --> 00:08:31,882
The method participants
scale success criteria.

168
00:08:32,014 --> 00:08:35,736
What proves it right or wrong,
and timeline and resources needed.

169
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,600
This plan becomes your input for
building your strategy model.

170
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,069
Once it's complete, it's
time to build your strategy.
