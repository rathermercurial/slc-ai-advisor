## 1. Purpose

**Purpose Detailed Analysis**:

Too Good To Go's purpose is fundamentally centered on eliminating food waste worldwide to combat climate change. The company was founded in 2015 in Denmark with the mission to "inspire and empower everyone to take action against food waste together." This purpose is driven by the stark reality that one-third of all food produced globally (approximately 1.3 billion tons annually worth $1.3 trillion) goes to waste, while food waste accounts for 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions and consumes 25% of all freshwater resources.

The company's purpose extends beyond just the environmental impact to address social and economic dimensions of food waste. They recognize that food waste represents a massive inefficiency in the global food system that affects communities, businesses, and the planet. Their B-Corp certification reinforces their commitment to using business as a force for good, prioritizing purpose alongside profit.

Too Good To Go's purpose statement reflects their belief that technology can create accessible solutions to complex global problems. They aim to make fighting food waste "easy, fun, and accessible" for everyone, recognizing that collective action is essential to address this systemic issue. The company views their app not just as a marketplace but as a movement catalyst that can drive behavioral change and raise awareness about food waste's environmental implications.

**Purpose Synopsis (25 words or fewer)**: Eliminate food waste worldwide by connecting consumers with surplus food from restaurants and stores, fighting climate change through accessible, collective action.

## 2. Customer Model

### Customers

**Customers Detailed Analysis**:

Too Good To Go operates a multi-sided platform with distinct customer types, each with different roles and motivations:

**Primary Customer Type - Consumers/Food Buyers**: Over 100 million registered users globally (as of 2024) who purchase discounted surplus food through the app. These customers include environmentally conscious consumers, budget-minded individuals, food enthusiasts seeking variety, and discovery-oriented users wanting to try new restaurants. The customer base spans across 19 countries, with particularly strong adoption in Europe (13.2 million users in the UK alone).

**Secondary Customer Type - Food Businesses**: Over 154,000 establishments including restaurants, cafes, bakeries, supermarkets, and grocery stores that sell their surplus food through the platform. This includes major chains like Starbucks, Costa Coffee, Greggs, Morrisons, Aldi, and thousands of independent businesses. These customers use the platform to monetize food that would otherwise be discarded.

**Early Adopters**: The platform launched in Copenhagen in March 2016, with early adopters being environmentally conscious consumers and sustainability-focused food businesses in Denmark. The initial customers were likely younger, tech-savvy individuals concerned about environmental issues and local restaurants and bakeries looking for solutions to reduce waste and recover costs.

**Customers Synopsis (25 words or fewer)**:

• **Businesses**: Restaurants, cafes, bakeries, supermarkets selling surplus food to recover costs and reduce waste

### Jobs to be Done

**Jobs to be Done Detailed Analysis**:

**For Consumer Customers**:
The primary functional job consumers are hiring Too Good To Go to do is to access quality food at affordable prices. However, the deeper psychological and emotional jobs are more profound. Consumers are hiring the service to feel good about themselves and their impact on the planet - addressing a need for purpose and meaning in their daily consumption choices. The "surprise bag" element adds an element of discovery and excitement, fulfilling a need for variety and spontaneity in their food choices.

Many consumers are also hiring the service to discover new local restaurants and food options they might not have tried otherwise, satisfying a desire for exploration and community connection. The app provides a way for consumers to align their purchasing behavior with their environmental values without requiring significant sacrifice or lifestyle changes.

**For Business Customers**:
Food businesses are hiring Too Good To Go to solve multiple problems: converting waste into revenue, demonstrating environmental responsibility to customers, and improving operational efficiency. Beyond the obvious financial recovery, businesses are using the platform to enhance their brand reputation among increasingly environmentally conscious consumers and to attract new customers who discover them through the app.

Restaurants are also hiring the service to address the psychological discomfort of food waste - many food service workers and owners feel genuinely distressed about throwing away perfectly good food, so the platform provides an ethical solution that aligns with their values.

**Jobs to be Done Synopsis (25 words or fewer)**:
• **Consumers**: Access affordable quality food while feeling good about environmental impact and discovering new local food options
• **Businesses**: Convert food waste into revenue while demonstrating sustainability and attracting environmentally conscious customers

### Existing Alternatives

**Existing Alternatives Detailed Analysis**:

**For Consumers**:
Before Too Good To Go, environmentally conscious consumers had limited options to address food waste. They could shop at discount grocery stores, visit restaurants during happy hour periods, use traditional coupon apps, or attempt to time their visits to bakeries and restaurants near closing time hoping for discounts. Many simply accepted higher food costs if they wanted to eat sustainably, or they focused their environmental efforts on other areas like recycling or energy conservation.

Some consumers would frequent food banks or community fridges, though these typically serve different demographics and needs. Others might have used general discount food apps or daily deal platforms, but these weren't specifically focused on surplus food or environmental impact.

**For Businesses**:
Traditional alternatives for businesses dealing with surplus food included donating to food banks or charities (which often involves complex logistics and liability concerns), offering end-of-day discounts manually, composting (which doesn't recover any revenue), or simply disposing of the food. Some businesses would try to give surplus food to employees or sell it through informal networks, but these solutions lacked scale and consistency.

Larger retailers might have had relationships with animal feed companies or industrial composting facilities, but smaller businesses often had no alternatives other than waste disposal.

**Existing Alternatives Synopsis (25 words or fewer)**:
• **Consumers**: Discount stores, happy hour deals, timing visits near closing, traditional coupon apps, accepting higher costs for sustainable eating
• **Businesses**: Food banks, manual end-of-day discounts, employee giveaways, composting, waste disposal without revenue recovery

### Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

**UVP Detailed Analysis**:

**For Consumers**:
Too Good To Go's unique value proposition centers on providing a guilt-free way to access quality food at significant discounts (typically 50-70% off) while making a tangible environmental impact. Unlike traditional discount food options, each purchase comes with clear metrics showing the environmental impact (CO2 saved, water conserved, land preserved), making the consumer feel like an environmental hero.

The "surprise bag" concept creates an element of excitement and discovery that traditional discounting lacks, turning each purchase into a small adventure. The app gamifies environmental action by tracking users' cumulative impact over time, providing a sense of achievement and progress.

The convenience of the mobile platform, combined with the feel-good factor of environmental impact, creates a unique emotional benefit that competitors can't easily replicate. Users get high-quality food, save money, help the environment, and often discover new favorite local spots - a multi-layered value proposition.

**For Businesses**:
For food businesses, Too Good To Go offers a unique solution that transforms a cost center (waste disposal) into a revenue stream while enhancing brand reputation. Unlike traditional discounting strategies that can devalue the brand, selling through Too Good To Go positions the business as environmentally responsible and attracts environmentally conscious customers.

The platform provides effortless implementation - businesses don't need to manage individual customer negotiations or complex logistics. The "surprise bag" model allows businesses to bundle various surplus items without having to manage detailed inventory tracking, making it operationally simple.

The marketing benefit is particularly unique - businesses gain exposure to millions of environmentally conscious consumers who might become regular customers after discovering them through the platform.

**UVP Synopsis (25 words or fewer)**:
• **Consumers**: Quality food at 50-70% discount with measurable environmental impact, discovery element, and guilt-free consumption aligned with values
• **Businesses**: Transform waste costs into revenue while enhancing brand reputation and attracting environmentally conscious customers

**Mobile Application**: A user-friendly app available on iOS and Android that allows consumers to browse nearby food businesses offering surplus food, make purchases, and track their environmental impact. The app uses location-based services to show relevant nearby options and provides detailed information about pickup times and business details.

**Business Dashboard**: A simple interface for food businesses to list surplus food in standardized "surprise bags" with flexible pricing (typically $3.99-$5.99) without requiring detailed inventory management. Businesses can set ongoing schedules based on typical surplus patterns or manually input daily availability.

**"Surprise Bag" Model**: A standardized packaging approach where businesses bundle surplus food into bags worth typically 3x the selling price, allowing for operational simplicity while creating an element of discovery for consumers.

**Payment and Logistics System**: Integrated payment processing with a streamlined pickup process where consumers show their phone at the designated time to collect their purchase, minimizing operational complexity for businesses.

## 3. Impact Model

### Issue

**Issue Detailed Analysis**:

Too Good To Go addresses the massive global problem of food waste, which represents one of the most significant contributors to climate change and environmental degradation. The scope of this issue is staggering: approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption (1.3 billion tons annually) is lost or wasted globally, representing $1.3 trillion in economic value.

The environmental impact is profound - food waste accounts for 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it a larger contributor to climate change than the entire aviation industry. Food waste also consumes 25% of all freshwater resources and uses 30% of global agricultural land. When food decomposes in landfills, it produces methane, a greenhouse gas 28 times more potent than CO2.

The issue operates at multiple levels: individual households waste food due to overbuying and confusion about date labels; businesses waste food due to overproduction, aesthetic standards, and lack of efficient redistribution systems; and systemic inefficiencies in the food supply chain create waste at every stage from farm to fork.

Beyond environmental impact, food waste represents a profound social injustice - while millions go hungry globally, perfectly edible food is discarded daily. The economic waste is enormous for businesses that invest in production, transportation, and preparation only to ultimately pay for disposal.

The issue is particularly acute in developed countries where food waste often occurs at the retail and consumer level, making it highly visible and emotionally distressing for both food service workers and environmentally conscious consumers.

**Issue Synopsis (25 words or fewer)**: Global food waste crisis: one-third of food produced is wasted, causing 10% of greenhouse gas emissions and massive environmental degradation.

The company has achieved significant organic growth through the viral nature of the "feel-good" environmental impact messaging.

### Financial Model

The primary revenue source is transaction fees from each "surprise bag" sale - typically $1.79 per transaction in the US market, representing roughly 30-40% of the consumer purchase price. This creates a scalable revenue model that grows directly with platform usage.

The company also generates revenue through annual membership fees from participating businesses ($89 annually in the US market, required only after businesses earn their first $89 in revenue). This creates recurring revenue while keeping barriers to entry low for small businesses.

Additional revenue streams include enterprise solutions for larger retailers, including modular software for surplus food management and inventory tracking. The company has also developed partnerships around their "Look, Smell, Taste" labeling initiative, which was featured on 1.7 billion products in 2022.

Based on 2023 financial data, Too Good To Go generated approximately $162 million in revenue (545 million DKK), demonstrating significant scale and growth trajectory.

**Cost Structure**:
Major ongoing expenses include technology development and platform maintenance, which is essential for scaling a digital marketplace. Marketing and customer acquisition costs are significant, particularly for expanding into new geographic markets and attracting new users and businesses.

Personnel costs include a global team of approximately 1,500 employees across engineering, business development, marketing, and operations. The company also invests heavily in impact measurement and reporting systems, educational content creation, and advocacy activities that support their mission but may not directly generate immediate revenue.

Geographic expansion costs include local market research, regulatory compliance, payment processing infrastructure, and establishing local business partnerships. The company operates in 19 countries, requiring significant investment in localization and market development.

**Financial Model Synopsis**:
- **Revenue (25 words)**: Transaction fees ($1.79 per bag), annual business memberships ($89), enterprise software solutions, and brand partnerships

## Final Analysis

**Final Analysis Detailed Assessment**:

Too Good To Go represents a remarkable example of how purpose-driven businesses can create sustainable competitive advantages while addressing critical global challenges. The company has successfully integrated three distinct but interconnected business models - customer value creation, environmental impact, and economic sustainability - into a cohesive platform that creates value for all stakeholders.

The strength of their business model lies in the elegant simplicity of connecting surplus food with consumers in a way that benefits everyone involved. Consumers get quality food at significant discounts while feeling good about their environmental impact. Businesses convert waste into revenue while enhancing their sustainability credentials. Society benefits from reduced environmental impact and increased awareness about food waste.

The company's use of technology to make environmental action accessible and rewarding has created a scalable solution that grows stronger with adoption. The network effects inherent in the platform, combined with their first-mover advantage and mission-driven brand positioning, create significant competitive moats that will be difficult for competitors to overcome.

Particularly noteworthy is Too Good To Go's approach to impact measurement and communication. By making abstract environmental benefits tangible and personal (showing users exactly how much CO2, water, and land they've saved), the company has gamified environmental action in a way that drives engagement and retention.

The financial model demonstrates strong unit economics with the transaction fee structure creating direct alignment between company revenue and social impact. The combination of transaction fees and subscription revenue provides both scalability and predictability, while the relatively asset-light business model enables rapid geographic expansion.

Too Good To Go's advocacy work and policy engagement represent an innovative approach to creating systemic change beyond just the direct platform impact. By working with major brands on date labeling campaigns and engaging with policymakers, the company is addressing root causes of food waste rather than just symptoms.

The company's B-Corp certification and authentic commitment to environmental and social impact provide significant advantages in an era where consumers and businesses increasingly prioritize purpose-driven organizations. This positioning will likely become even more valuable as ESG considerations become more central to business decisions.

**Final Analysis Synopsis (5-7 lines)**:
Too Good To Go demonstrates how purpose-driven business models can create sustainable competitive advantages while addressing global challenges. Their elegant platform creates value for all stakeholders through network effects, first-mover advantage, and authentic mission alignment. The combination of transaction-based revenue, strong unit economics, and asset-light expansion enables rapid scaling. Their approach to making environmental impact tangible and rewarding has created a highly engaging user experience. The company's advocacy work and policy engagement drive systemic change beyond direct platform impact. Too Good To Go represents a new paradigm for sustainable business models that prioritize planet and profit simultaneously.
