## P2P FRAMING

p2p 5.2 assessing-stage 1.webm

**[MAIN PANEL: Venture Stage Map diagram]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
You're about to work through the Core content on stage assessment. This introduces the Venture Stage Map - a framework that helps you understand where you are on the venture development journey.

The Core Framework breaks the journey into four stages: Idea, Early, Growth, and Scale. It shows how to assess progress across four dimensions: Customer Model, Impact Model, Economic Model, and Organization.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Idea → Early → Growth → Scale | Four dimensions]**

This framework applies to all ventures. After the Core content, we'll talk about what stage progression looks like specifically for Purpose Pivot Ventures.

**Tag line:** **Map your journey.**

## P2P COMMENTARY

p2p 5.2 assessing-stage 2.webm

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Stage Assessment for PPVs"]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just walked you through the Venture Stage Map and how to assess where you are across the four dimensions.

Now let's talk about what this looks like for Purpose Pivot Ventures.

**Tag line:** **P2P stage progression.**

---

### Same Stages, Scaled Down

**[MAIN PANEL: Side-by-side comparison of funded venture vs. PPV progression]**

First, understand this: the stages are the same for everyone. Idea to Early to Growth to Scale. This journey is universal.

What's different for p2p ventures is the scale of execution.

What a team of five does with $500k funding, you might do solo with $5k from savings. What takes a funded startup six months of full-time work might take you eighteen months while still employed.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Same journey | Different scale | Your pace is valid]**

The stages describe the maturity and validation of your business model, not the size of your team or the amount of capital you've raised.

You can be at Early stage with a solo operation validated through customer conversations and small pilots. You don't need a team of ten and $100k raised to reach Early stage. You just need the validation work done, and this will require more or less funding and team size depending on the particulars of your business model. 

**Tag line:** **Scale fits your context.**

### Examples from the Library

**[MAIN PANEL: Three example ventures side by side]**

Let's look at how this could play out using some examples from the p2p example library. Again, we are playing with these examples to help us understand how these p2p business models behave, not describing how they actually did it. 

**Plausible Analytics** - Software & AI category. For this kind of business model,Two founders could validate and build to Early stage with no external funding and minimal infrastructure. They could validated customer need through conversations, built an MVP themselves, got early paying customers, all while working from home with cloud infrastructure. Low organizational commitment. Fast path to revenue proof.

**DesignJoy** - Productized Services category. For this business model, a solo founder could get revenue proof quickly through direct client work, then systematize into a subscription design service. Organizational needs would stay minimal through Early stage - just the founder and eventually some contractors. They validate the full model through Early stage and into growth stage before needing any significant infrastructure.

**Linking Your Thinking** - Content, Education & Community category. A solo found building in public through content could validate audience interest and willingness to pay through newsletter and early workshops. Organizational commitment staying light - one person creating content and running cohorts. Impact model of helping people think better validated through testimonials and community engagement. Revenue proof from workshop sales before building any complex infrastructure.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Validate solo | Revenue proof fast | Minimal org needs]**

Notice the pattern. These business models let you progress from Idea stage through Early stage without requiring teams, offices, or significant capital. The validation work is doable solo or with a tiny team.

That's what makes them P2P-appropriate business models.

**Tag line:** **Examples show the way.**

### Your Stage Assessment

**[MAIN PANEL: Blank Venture Stage Map]**

Now assess your own venture using the Stage Map framework.

Look across all four dimensions. Where is your Customer Model? Your Impact Model? Your Economic Model? Your Organization?

If you're still employed and working on this part-time, you're probably at Idea stage organizationally. That's normal and good. You don't need to quit your job to make progress on validation.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Assess all four | Imbalance is normal early | Progress is progress]**

If your models are at different stages, that's okay. It's common. 

The important thing is understanding where you are so you can plan what to validate next to realign the three models and keep them moving forward together. 


**Tag line:** **Know your starting point.**

---

### Ready for Validation

**[MAIN PANEL: Transition to Validation section]**

You know where you are now. Time to figure out how to move forward.

That's what validation is for. Testing your riskiest assumptions systematically so you can progress through stages with confidence.

Let's dive into validation.

You are about to walk through the
core content on stage assessment.

2
00:00:03,974 --> 00:00:07,902
This introduces the venture stage
map, a framework that helps you

3
00:00:07,902 --> 00:00:10,572
understand where you are on the
venture development journey.

4
00:00:11,234 --> 00:00:14,371
The core framework breaks
the journey into four stages.

5
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:17,281
Idea, early growth, and scale.

6
00:00:17,793 --> 00:00:21,183
It shows how to assess progress
across four dimensions.

7
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:21,903
Customer model.

8
00:00:22,383 --> 00:00:26,013
Impact model, economic
model, and organization.

9
00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:29,953
As always, this framework
applies to all ventures.

10
00:00:30,045 --> 00:00:34,003
After the core content, we'll talk
about what stage progression looks like

11
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:36,133
specifically for purpose pivot ventures.


p2p 5.2 assessing-stage 2.webm.03.mp4.webm

1
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:04,284
The core framework just walked you through
the venture stage map and how to assess

2
00:00:04,284 --> 00:00:06,624
where you are across the four dimensions.

3
00:00:06,995 --> 00:00:10,325
Now let's talk about what this
looks like for P two P ventures like

4
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:15,577
yours First, understanding this, the
stages are the same for everyone.

5
00:00:15,997 --> 00:00:20,167
Idea to early to growth to
scale this journey is universal.

6
00:00:20,494 --> 00:00:24,244
What's different for P two P
Ventures is the scale of execution,

7
00:00:24,821 --> 00:00:29,047
what a team of five does with
$500,000 of funding, you might

8
00:00:29,047 --> 00:00:31,867
do solo with $5,000 from savings.

9
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:33,610
What takes a funded startup?

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,203
Six months of full-time work might take
you 18 months while you're still employed.

11
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:43,540
The stage describes the maturity and
validation of the business model,

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,410
not the size of your team or the
amount of capital you've raised.

13
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:51,893
You can be early stage with a solo
operation, validated through customer

14
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:53,993
conversations and small pilots.

15
00:00:54,127 --> 00:00:57,309
You don't need a team of 10
and a hundred thousand dollars

16
00:00:57,309 --> 00:00:59,229
raised to reach early stage.

17
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:03,730
You just need the validation work done,
and this will require more or less

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,570
funding and team size depending on the
particulars of your business model.

19
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:11,358
Let's look at how this could
play out using some examples

20
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:13,038
from the P two P example library.

21
00:01:13,402 --> 00:01:13,852
Again.

22
00:01:13,852 --> 00:01:17,092
We're playing with these examples
to help us understand how P

23
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:18,712
two P business models behave.

24
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,060
Not describing how these particular
ventures actually did it.

25
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:24,081
Plausible analytics.

26
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:28,225
This is the software and AI category
this kind of business model, two

27
00:01:28,225 --> 00:01:31,885
founders could validate and build
to early stage with no external

28
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:33,690
funding and minimal infrastructure.

29
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:35,209
They could validate.

30
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:39,625
Customer's need through conversations,
build an MVP themselves.

31
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:42,909
Get early paying customers
all while working from home

32
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:44,079
with cloud infrastructure.

33
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:49,433
Low organizational commitment,
fast path to revenue design joy

34
00:01:49,463 --> 00:01:53,178
as a productized service category
example for this business model.

35
00:01:53,178 --> 00:01:57,711
A solo founder could get revenue proof
quickly through direct client work.

36
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:01,905
Then systematize into a
subscription design service.

37
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:06,537
Organizational needs would stay minimal
through early stage, just the founder,

38
00:02:06,597 --> 00:02:08,247
and eventually some contractors.

39
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,359
They validate the full model through
early stage and into growth stage before

40
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:14,219
needing any significant infrastructure.

41
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:19,047
Linking your thinking as a content
education and community category.

42
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:20,839
Example, a solo founder.

43
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:24,636
Building in public through content
could validate audience interests

44
00:02:24,636 --> 00:02:28,505
and willingness to pay through
newsletters and early workshops.

45
00:02:28,893 --> 00:02:32,344
Organizational commitments,
staying light, one person creating

46
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:34,046
content and running cohorts.

47
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:37,434
The impact model of helping people
think better, validated through

48
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:39,864
testimonials and community engagement.

49
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:44,893
Revenue proof from workshop sales before
building any complex infrastructure.

50
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,950
Notice the pattern here.

51
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,970
These business models let you
progress from idea stage through

52
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,687
early stage without requiring teams,
offices, or significant capital.

53
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,180
The validation work is doable
solo or with a tiny team.

54
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,350
That's what makes them P two
P. Appropriate business models.

55
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:07,205
Now, assess your own venture
using the stage map framework.

56
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:07,775
again.

57
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:09,275
Look across all four dimensions.

58
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:12,679
Where is your customer model at
your impact model, your economic

59
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:14,059
model, your organization?

60
00:03:14,835 --> 00:03:18,199
If you're still employed and just
starting out working on this part-time,

61
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:20,479
you're probably at idea stage.

62
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,118
Organizationally, that's normal and good.

63
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,741
You don't need to quit your job
to make progress on validation.

64
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:30,155
If your models are at
different stages, that's okay.

65
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:30,905
It's common.

66
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,835
The important thing is to understand
where you're at so you can plan what

67
00:03:34,835 --> 00:03:39,197
to validate next to realign these four
models and keep them moving forward.

68
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:41,343
Now you know where you're at.

69
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,420
Time to figure out how to move forward.

70
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,500
That's what validation is for.

71
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,241
Testing your risky assumptions
systematically so you can progress

72
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,011
through the stages with confidence.

73
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:52,773
Let's dive into validation.
