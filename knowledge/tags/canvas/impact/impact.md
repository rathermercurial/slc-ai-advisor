## Structure

The impact model follows a sequential flow:
**Issue → Participants → Activities → Outputs → Short-term Outcomes → Medium-term Outcomes → Long-term Outcomes → Impact**

## Components

### [Issue](issue.md)
A clear articulation of the social or environmental problem identified in the purpose.

### [Participants](participants.md)
Key stakeholders directly involved or impacted by the enterprise's activities (may overlap with customers).

### [Activities](activities.md)
Specific actions taken by or involving participants, designed to initiate impact (also reflected in the solution).

### [Outputs](outputs.md)
Direct, immediate results of activities (what is produced).

### [Short-term Outcomes](short-term-outcomes.md)
Immediate, measurable changes resulting directly from activities.

### [Medium-term Outcomes](medium-term-outcomes.md)
Subsequent, measurable effects (1-2 years) building from short-term outcomes.

### [Long-term Outcomes](long-term-outcomes.md)
Sustained, positive changes over an extended period (2-10 years).

### [Impact](impact.md)
The ultimate state of change reflecting successful realization of the enterprise's purpose, typically broad and inspirational.

## Key Principles

- **Causality**: Each step should logically lead to the next
- **Measurability**: Outcomes should be quantifiable where possible
- **Attribution**: Changes should be reasonably attributable to your activities
- **Timeframes**: Distinguish between immediate, short, medium, and long-term effects
