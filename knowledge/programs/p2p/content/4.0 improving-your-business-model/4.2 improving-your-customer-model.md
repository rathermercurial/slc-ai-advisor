<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
You're about to work through the Core content on improving your customer model. This is critical work - getting your customer model right affects everything else.

The Core Framework walks through diagnostic checks, fundamentals, beachhead strategy, early adopters, and strategic levers for improvement. It shows you how to assess whether your market is big enough and how to strengthen weak areas.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Assess | Find weaknesses | Improve systematically]**

Pay attention to the beachhead concept. The Core Framework emphasizes narrow focus - finding that core segment you can win first. This matters even more when you're solo or small team. You can't serve broad markets. You need laser focus.

Also watch the TAM times ARPU math. Total addressable market times annual revenue per user. This tells you if your market is big enough. But the calculation works differently at P2P scale than for venture-backed startups.

After the Core content, we'll come back and talk about what customer model improvement looks like for P2P Ventures specifically.

**Tag line:** **Beachhead and math.**

## P2P COMMENTARY

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Customer Model for PPVs"]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just walked you through how to assess and improve your customer model. Diagnostic checks, beachhead strategy, strategic levers, and the improvement process.

Now let's talk about what this means for ventures like yours.

**Tag line:** **P2P customer focus.**

---

### You Must Go Narrow

**[MAIN PANEL: Wide market vs. narrow beachhead visual]**

First, the beachhead principle is non-negotiable for PPVs.

You cannot serve broad markets solo. You don't have the resources. You don't have the channels. You don't have the time.

Remember 1,000 True Fans from when we filled in the Customer Model?  You need a minimum viable audience - a focused group who desperately wants what you're building.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Can't serve everyone | Must go narrow | Find desperate buyers]**

This is actually liberating. You're not trying to be everything to everyone. You're trying to be the perfect solution for a specific group of people who have a specific problem.

If your beachhead still feels too broad - like "small business owners" or "people interested in productivity" - narrow again. Keep narrowing until you can clearly see the faces of these customers. Until you know where they hang out online. Until you can describe their exact pain.

**Tag line:** **Narrow wins.**

### The Math Works at Your Scale

**[MAIN PANEL: TAM × ARPU calculation visual]**

The Core Framework showed you TAM times ARPU - total addressable market times annual revenue per user. This tells you if your market is big enough.

]The math work the same for small ventures but just at much smaller scale.

Let's say you need to replace a $100k salary. Add $20k for costs - tools, subscriptions, some contractor help. You need $120k in revenue to be sustainable.

**[VISUAL TEXT: $100k income | $20k costs | $120k revenue needed]**

How many customers does that take?

One thousand customers at $120 per year works. That's $10 per month subscriptions.

Or one hundred customers at $1,200 per year. That's $100 per month.

Or twenty customers at $6,000 per year. That's $500 per month retainers or a $6k annual fee.

**[VISUAL TEXT: 1,000 at $120 | 100 at $1,200 | 20 at $6,000]**

These are different models. To suit  dfferent segments. But all viable at P2P scale.

You don't need millions of customers. You don't need massive TAM. You need enough customers at the right ARPU to hit your sustainability number.

This changes what "big enough" means. A market that's too small for a VC-backed startup or a large social enterprise might be perfect for you.

**Tag line:** **Small can win.**

### Use AI to Accelerate Research

**[MAIN PANEL: Research workflow diagram]**

The Core Framework mentioned using AI tools for research and brainstorming. This matters even more for solo founders.

You can use AI to help estimate TAM for your beachhead segment. Research what competitors charge. Analyze customer segments and identify which have the strongest jobs to be done. Generate ideas for adjacent segments you might not have considered.

**[VISUAL TEXT: TAM estimation | Competitor research | Segment analysis | Idea generation]**

This replaces work that used to require hiring research firms or spending weeks manually gathering data. You can do in hours what used to take weeks and thousands of dollars.

AI is particularly good at pattern matching across markets and helping you see possibilities you might miss on your own. Use it throughout the improvement process - for research, for brainstorming strategic levers, for testing your logic.

**Tag line:** **AI accelerates work.**

### Example: Linking Your Thinking

**[MAIN PANEL: Linking Your Thinking canvas - Customer Model section]**

Let's look at an example. Let's use Linking Your Thinking and think about how they might have found their beachhead market. Now remember we are just playing with these examples. We don't know the detail of how they developed their early business model, but thinking through how it might have done it helps us understand the dynamics and decisionmaking involved. 

At Linking Your Thinking, Nick Milo could have gone broad with his market to: "Anyone interested in note-taking" or "people who want to be more productive" or "knowledge workers who need better systems."

Huge potential markets. Millions of people. But also impossible to serve well as a solo creator.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Could have: Anyone in note-taking | Millions of people | Impossible solo]**

Instead, he went narrow: Obsidian power users who want to level up their personal knowledge management.

Not ,all Personal Knowledge-Management Systems enthusiasts. Not all Obsidian users. Power users who are already deep into Obsidian and want to go further. People who've already chosen Obsidian over other tools and are committed to mastering it.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Actually: Obsidian power users | Want to level up | Committed + motivated]**

**[MAIN PANEL: Show beachhead segment characteristics]**

This beachhead works because:

They're identifiable. They hang out in Obsidian forums, the Obsidian subreddit, specific Discord servers. Nick knows exactly where to find them.

They have urgent pain. They're hitting the limits of basic Obsidian usage and getting frustrated. They want to unlock more potential but don't know how.

They're willing to pay. These are people who've already invested time and energy into learning Obsidian on their own initiative, they value learning and progress. They'll likely pay for a workshop that accelerates their progress.

The segment is big enough. Obsidian has hundreds of thousands of users. Power users might be five to ten percent of that. That's thousands of potential customers. More than enough.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Identifiable | Urgent pain | Will pay | Big enough]**

Let's do the math. If Nick needs $150k revenue to be sustainable - supporting himself and some costs - how many customers does he need?

His workshop is around $500. To hit $150k, he needs 300 customers per year. That's running four cohorts of 75 people. Or six cohorts of 50 people.

Completely achievable within that beachhead segment of Obsidian power users.

**[VISUAL TEXT: $500 workshop | $150k goal | 300 customers/year | 4-6 cohorts]**

**[MAIN PANEL: Return to full Customer Model canvas]**

And notice what happened. By going narrow, Nick can serve this segment incredibly well. The workshop is specifically designed for Obsidian. The examples use Obsidian. The community is all Obsidian users helping each other.

This creates better outcomes for customers, stronger word of mouth, and a sustainable business model at P2P scale.

That's the power of a focused beachhead.

**Tag line:** **Narrow enables excellence.**

### Your Turn

**[MAIN PANEL: Customer Model section on blank canvas]**

Now apply this to your own customer model.

Work through the Core Framework's improvement process. Gather input from advisors and use AI tools for research. Check the example library for similar ventures.

But as you do this, keep the P2P lens front and center:

Go narrow. Narrower than feels comfortable. Find that beachhead segment you can win with.

Do the TAM times ARPU math at your scale. Not venture scale. Your scale. What do you need to be sustainable?


**[VISUAL TEXT: Go narrow | Do your math | Use AI tools]**

Document your assumptions. Write down what you believe about your customer model. Who they are, what they need, what they'll pay. You'll test these assumptions in the Strategy section when you start validating.
