# Research Report on Tony's Chocolonely

## Background

Tony's Chocolonely is a Dutch chocolate company founded in 2005 by journalist Teun van de Keuken, who investigated forced labor in West African cocoa farms. The company operates as an "impact company that makes chocolate" rather than a traditional chocolate manufacturer, with a mission to make the entire chocolate industry 100% slave-free. Tony's Chocolonely is a direct-to-consumer (DTC) confectionary company, on a mission to rewire the cocoa industry. Or as they put in their brand statement: "Crazy about chocolate, serious about people" The company is committed to making the world's chocolate 100% slave-free by addressing problematic workers' conditions in the cocoa plantations.

## 1. Purpose

**Purpose Detailed Analysis:**

Tony's Chocolonely exists to end all forms of exploitation in the cocoa industry, specifically to eliminate child labour and all illegal labour in the entire chocolate supply chain. The company's evolved mission statement is "Together, we'll end exploitation in cocoa", which expands beyond their original slave-free focus to address interconnected forms of exploitation including ensuring living income and combating deforestation.

In Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire alone, 1.56 million children in cocoa-growing households are involved in child labour, 30,000 people are victims of forced labour and 60,000 hectares of tropical forest have been cleared for cocoa production since January 2019 alone. Tony's deliberately sources from these regions because that's where more than 60% of the world's cocoa is produced – and where some of the biggest challenges lie.

The company's purpose is institutionally protected through Tony's Mission Lock – a legal structure to ensure its impact mission, its 5 Sourcing Principles and its core values cannot be amended without approval of the new governing structure; overseen by three, independent Mission Guardians. This ensures the mission remains intact regardless of ownership changes or commercial pressures.

**Purpose Synopsis (25 words or fewer):** 
End all forms of exploitation in cocoa through industry transformation, ensuring slave-free chocolate with living wages, environmental protection, and systemic change.

• **Mission Allies:** Proven ethical sourcing methodology with established farmer relationships, verified impact metrics, and shared infrastructure for efficient transformation

### Solution

**Solution Detailed Analysis:**

Tony's Chocolonely's solution centers on their **5 Sourcing Principles** that address root causes of exploitation:

1. **Traceable Cocoa Beans:** The company buys beans from cooperatives and uses a digital 'Bean Tracker' platform, that identifies which farmers supplied what percentage of each shipped container. This makes the supply entirely traceable

2. **Higher Price for Farmers:** Tony's always pays the Living Income Reference Price (LIRP) for cocoa, which is higher than both the national farmgate price + the Fairtrade price combined. Tony's pays a 20% premium on top of the world market price for its cocoa

3. **Strong Farmer Cooperatives:** Tony's has five-year supply deals with its cooperatives, which is longer than the industry norm, providing stability and enabling long-term investment

4. **Long-term Relationships:** Tony's long-term partner co-ops (3+ years) have an even lower rate of child labor at 4.4 percent demonstrating the importance of sustained partnerships

5. **Productivity and Quality Improvement:** Supporting farmers with training, tools, and resources to increase yields and income

**Product Delivery:** Tony's produces unevenly divided chocolate bars, symbolizing the unequal distribution of incomes in the chocolate industry in multiple flavors and sizes. Tony's bars for all its markets are produced by two contract manufacturers in Belgium

**Industry Transformation:** Through Tony's Open Chain initiative that enables other brands to make chocolate using Tony's 5 Sourcing Principles, scaling impact beyond their own production.

**Solution Synopsis (25 words or fewer):**
Premium Belgian chocolate bars with proven 5 Sourcing Principles: traceable beans, living income pricing, strong cooperatives, long-term partnerships, productivity improvement.

## 3. Impact Model

### Issue

**Issue Detailed Analysis:**

The core issue Tony's addresses is systemic exploitation in the global cocoa industry, particularly in West Africa where more than 60% of the world's cocoa is produced. The problem manifests in multiple interconnected forms:

**Child Labor:** More than 1.5m children work illegally on cocoa plantations and 1 in every 2 children in cocoa-growing households in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana is engaged in child labour

**Modern Slavery:** Forced labour affecting 30,000 individuals in the cocoa supply chain

**Poverty:** The average farmer cultivates between three and five hectares to earn less than two dollars a day, creating conditions that force families into exploitative labor practices

**Environmental Destruction:** 80-95% of rainforests in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana have been lost since 1955, with cocoa production causing one-third of this destruction

**Supply Chain Opacity:** Almost no other chocolate brand sold in supermarkets knows where or how its cocoa beans are grown. They rarely build relationships with farmers who grow their cocoa

**Systemic Underinvestment:** Millions of West African cocoa farmers unable to earn a living income, resulting in poverty, illegal labour, deforestation, and underinvestment in their farms, leading to supply loss

The issue is perpetuated by major chocolate companies' purchasing practices and industry structure that prioritizes cost reduction over farmer welfare.

**Issue Synopsis (25 words or fewer):**
Systemic exploitation in West African cocoa: 1.5M children in illegal labor, 30,000 in forced labor, poverty, deforestation, supply chain opacity.

**Industry-Wide Transformation:** Moving beyond their own supply chain to influence 'the big seven' chocolate companies - Nestlé, Mars, Mondelez, Hershey, Cargill, Barry Callebaut, and Olam - to adopt ethical practices across their global operations.

**Systemic Change in West Africa:** Creating a cocoa industry where millions of West African cocoa farmers can earn a living income, breaking the cycle of poverty that drives exploitation and environmental destruction.

**Global Supply Chain Ethics:** Establishing new standards where chocolate brands know where and how their cocoa beans are grown and build relationships with farmers becomes the industry norm rather than the exception.

**Regulatory and Legal Framework:** Supporting human rights legislation that holds companies legally accountable for modern slavery and illegal child labour in their supply chains, creating systemic accountability.

**Consumer Consciousness:** Transforming consumer expectations so that ethical sourcing becomes a baseline requirement rather than a premium offering, making exploitation commercially unviable.

**Environmental Restoration:** Achieving zero deforestation in cocoa supply chains and supporting regenerative agriculture practices that restore degraded ecosystems.

The ultimate success metric is when Tony's mission becomes obsolete - when the entire chocolate industry operates according to their principles without need for their intervention or differentiation.

## Final Analysis

**Final Analysis Detailed Assessment:**

Tony's Chocolonely has successfully created an integrated business model that proves ethical practices can drive both social impact and commercial success. Their approach addresses a fundamental market failure in the chocolate industry where the average farmer cultivates between three and five hectares to earn less than two dollars a day while generating a $15+ billion global chocolate industry.

The company's most significant innovation is demonstrating that ending exploitation of West African farming families can come in parallel with good returns for shareholders. By paying Living Income Reference Price (LIRP) for cocoa, which is higher than both the national farmgate price + the Fairtrade price combined, they've achieved 51% increase in farmer income while maintaining commercial viability.

Their platform strategy through Tony's Open Chain initiative creates network effects that scale impact beyond their direct production. With 14 partners including all major Dutch grocery groups, they're transforming industry norms rather than just creating a niche alternative.

The Mission Lock governance structure represents a breakthrough in impact company design, ensuring that impact mission, 5 Sourcing Principles and core values cannot be amended without approval of independent Mission Guardians, protecting against mission drift during growth and ownership changes.

Their technology-enabled transparency through digital Bean Tracker platform and GPS-polygon mapping creates competitive advantages while enabling impact measurement and accountability that traditional suppliers cannot match.

**Final Analysis Synopsis:**
Successfully integrated ethical sourcing with commercial growth, proving 51% farmer income increases compatible with 23% revenue growth. Platform strategy scaling through 14 Mission Allies. Mission Lock governance protects impact integrity. Technology-enabled transparency creates competitive advantage while transforming industry norms toward accountability.
