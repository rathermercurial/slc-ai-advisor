## P2P FRAMING



<span style="color:green"> p2p 3.2.2 customer-model 1.webm.02.mp4.webm</span> 


**[MAIN PANEL: Customer Model sections on canvas]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
Next you are going to work through the Core content on the Customer Model. This is where you map out how you create value for customers—the foundation of your business model.

The Core Framework walks through four key sections: Customers, Jobs to be Done, Unique Value Proposition, and Solution. You'll see how these pieces fit together as a coherent system.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Customers | JTBD | UVP | Solution]**

The Core content uses the term "social enterprise" broadly—this includes P2P ventures like yours. 

After you've gone through the framework core, we'll come back and talk about what matters most for P2P ventures specifically

**Tag line:** **Value creation starts here.**

## P2P COMMENTARY



<span style="color:green"> p2p 3.2.2 customer-model 2.webm.02.mp4.webm</span> 


**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Customer Model for PPVs"]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just walked you through the Customer Model—how to identify customers, understand their jobs to be done, craft unique value propositions, and design solutions. Now let's talk about this with a P2P flavor 

**Tag line:** **PPV customer strategy.**

---

### Mindset: 1,000 True Fans

**[MAIN PANEL: Visual showing small KK and 1000 true fans]**

First, a mindset shift. Small can be better, 

Kevin Kelly's concept of "1,000 True Fans" gives us a useful lens here.

You don't need millions of customers to build a viable venture. You need a minimum viable audience—people willing to directly support what you're building through subscriptions, purchases, memberships, whatever fits your model.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Small audience | Direct support | Viable business]**

For Purpose Pivot Ventures, this is strategic. Going narrow and deep with a niche group who really values what you offer can be more powerful than trying to serve a broad market. Especially when you're solo or small team.

**Tag line:** **Small and viable.**

---

### Building a Machine

**[MAIN PANEL: Flow diagram - Customers → JTBD → UVP → Solution]**

Remember, you're building a machine. Not just selling your time. Not just being labor.

For your machine to be scalable and repeatable, it needs a reliable way to create value. Your customer model does this by stringing together:

- Identifiable customers
- Jobs they need done
- Value propositions they'll engage with
- Solutions that deliver

**[VISUAL TEXT: System, not services | Repeatable value creation]**

All four pieces need to work together elegantly. If one piece is weak, the whole model struggles.

**Tag line:** **Build the system.**

---

### Beware Complexity: Customer Types Matter

**[MAIN PANEL: Simple model vs. complex multi-customer-type model]**

Be particularly aware of complexity in your customer model. The more complex your model the more difficult and expensive it will be to validate. 

 More customer types means multiplied work. Each customer type has its own jobs to be done, its own value proposition. You have to validate each one separately. More complexity, more validation work, more risk of getting things wrong.

**[VISUAL TEXT: More types = More JTBD | More UVPs | More validation | More risk]**

Let's look at two examples from the library to understand this better. 

**[MAIN PANEL: Plausible Analytics canvas - Customer section]**

Plausible Analytics keeps it simple. Single customer type—privacy-conscious developers who need web analytics.

Their flow: Developers frustrated with Google Analytics (customer) need privacy-respecting analytics (JTBD) that doesn't compromise on features (UVP) delivered through a lightweight, open-source tool (solution).

Clean. One customer type, one clear flow. Solo-founder viable.

**[MAIN PANEL: Ridwell canvas - Customer section]**

Ridwell is more complex. They have 2 customer types—households who want to recycle hard-to-recycle items, and city/waste partners who need better recycling solutions.

Each type has different jobs, different value propositions. The household customer wants convenience and environmental impact. The city partner wants cost reduction and sustainability metrics. Two distinct flows that have to work together.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Ridwell | 2 customer types | 2x validation work | Higher complexity]**

Does Ridwell need this complexity? Probably. Their model requires it. So they will have gone  eyes open knowing they'd have to validate and serve two different customer type.

If you're adding a second (or more) customer type, ask hard questions about whether you really need it. Sometimes you do. Just understand you're signing up for multiplied work and risk.

**Tag line:** **Simple beats complex.**

---

### P2P Constraints on Segment Selection

**[MAIN PANEL: Channel types - content/SEO/community vs. high-touch sales]**

When you're choosing customer segments, as a solo or small venture you will probably face some constraints.

Channel constraints. A solo founder will find it hard to do high-touch enterprise sales calls, you won't be able to afford a sales team. You need customers who can find you through content, SEO, community or word of mouth. Channels you can automate or scale without you needing to be everywhere at once.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Content-driven | SEO | Community | Not high-touch sales]**

Choose customers who value small. Some segments actively prefer solo or small teams—they get faster response times, more specialized expertise, a personal touch. Others want the appearance of a big company. Pick segments that work with what you are.

Look for async communication opportunities. You can't be available 24/7. Customers who expect instant support or constant hand-holding are tough to serve solo. Choose segments and usecases where asynchronous communication will be accepted

**[VISUAL TEXT: Value small | Async-friendly | Match your constraints]**

**Tag line:** **Choose compatible segments.**

---

### Purpose as UVP Amplifier

**[MAIN PANEL: Buy Me Once and Plausible Analytics UVP sections]**

Not all P2P Ventures will have well-developed purpose narratives. You might be doing this for yourself and your family—that story might not strengthen your business model beyond improving your own motivation.

But if your purpose can play a role in the attractiveness of your solution, the Customer Model is where it shows up.

For our Buy Me Once example— the desire for sustainable products is the core engine of value creation for customers and delivers the impact model for the venture. Purpose is integral to the value proposition that drives customers to engage. 

For Plausible Analytics—their mission to solve surveillance capitalism problems folds directly into their value proposition: "Privacy without Sacrifice" and "Transparency Through Open Source."

**[VISUAL TEXT: Purpose → UVP (when it fits)]**

If your authentic voice and commitment to purpose can strengthen your value proposition, lean into it. If not, that's fine too.

**Tag line:** **Purpose when relevant.**

---

### AI Enables Solo Operation

**[MAIN PANEL: Icons showing AI tools supporting different functions]**

Modern AI and digital tools make solo customer models viable in ways they weren't five years ago.

Content creation, customer research, marketing, logistics—you can leverage tools to do work that used to require teams. We'll dive deeper into specific tools and approaches in module 2 where we'll work on improving your business model.

For now, just know that being solo doesn't mean doing everything manually.

**[VISUAL TEXT: AI augments | Details in Section 4]**

**Tag line:** **AI enables scale.**

---

### Practical Guidance

**[MAIN PANEL: Customer Model sections on canvas]**

Keep it simple on your first pass. Get the basics down—customers, jobs, value propositions, solution.

If you're adding multiple customer types, pause and ask if you really need them. The complexity might be necessary, but go in eyes open.

Check out the P2P Example Library to see how different ventures mapped their customer models. The Core Example Library has additional examples showing various approaches.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
Next, you're gonna work through the
core content on the customer model.

2
00:00:03,206 --> 00:00:07,376
This is where you map out how you
create value for your customers.

3
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:09,626
This is the foundation
of your business model.

4
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:15,379
The core framework walks you through four
key sections, customers, jobs to be done,

5
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:18,319
unique, value proposition and solution.

6
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:23,299
You'll see how these four pieces fit
together into a single coherent system.

7
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:28,012
The core content uses the terms
social enterprise quite broadly,

8
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:29,452
so just bear this in mind.

9
00:00:29,452 --> 00:00:32,032
This includes P two P ventures like yours.

10
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:35,281
After you've gone through the
core framework, we'll come back

11
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:38,611
and talk about what matters
specifically for P two P ventures.





p2p 3.2.2 customer-model 2.webm.02.mp4.webm


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,572
The core framework just walked you
through the customer model, how to

2
00:00:03,572 --> 00:00:07,802
identify customers, understand their
jobs to be done, craft unique value

3
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:10,217
propositions, and design solutions.

4
00:00:10,517 --> 00:00:14,597
Now, let's talk about what this
means with a P two P flavor.

5
00:00:15,243 --> 00:00:17,013
First, a bit of a mindset shift.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,828
For P two P ventures, small can be better.

7
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:26,022
Kevin Kelly's concept of a thousand
true fans gives us a useful lens here.

8
00:00:26,437 --> 00:00:30,127
You don't need millions of
customers to build a viable venture.

9
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:33,139
You need a minimum viable audience.

10
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:36,165
People willing to directly
support what you're building

11
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:40,005
through subscriptions, purchases,
memberships, whatever fits your model.

12
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,613
For a purpose pivot
venture, this is strategic.

13
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:48,523
Going narrow and deep with a niche
group who really value what you

14
00:00:48,523 --> 00:00:52,645
can offer can be more powerful
than trying to go broad, especially

15
00:00:52,645 --> 00:00:54,115
when you're a solo or small team.

16
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,873
Remember, you're building a
machine, not just selling your

17
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:00,772
time, not just being labor.

18
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:04,234
For your machine to be scalable
and repeatable, it needs a

19
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:06,154
reliable way to create value.

20
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:10,721
Your customer model does this by
stringing together identifiable

21
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:15,467
customers jobs, they need done value
propositions they'll engage with

22
00:01:15,797 --> 00:01:17,447
and solutions that will deliver.

23
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:21,039
These all four pieces need
to work together elegantly.

24
00:01:21,383 --> 00:01:23,783
If one piece is weak, the
whole model struggles.

25
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:28,228
Be particularly aware of
complexity in your customer model.

26
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:32,338
The more complex your model, the more
difficult and expensive it will be.

27
00:01:32,338 --> 00:01:36,246
To validate more customer
types means multiplied work.

28
00:01:36,502 --> 00:01:40,792
Each customer type has its own jobs
to be done, its own value proposition.

29
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:43,674
You have to validate each one separately.

30
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:48,599
More complexity, more validation work,
and more risk of getting things wrong.

31
00:01:49,449 --> 00:01:53,456
Let's look at a couple of examples from
the library to better understand this.

32
00:01:54,017 --> 00:01:56,346
Plausible analytics keeps it simple.

33
00:01:56,496 --> 00:02:01,728
Single customer type, privacy conscious
developers who need web analytics, their

34
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:07,198
flow developers, frustrated with Google
Analytics, that's the customer need.

35
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:11,803
Privacy, respecting analytics, that's the
job to be done that doesn't compromise.

36
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:17,553
On features, that's the UVP delivered
through a lightweight open source tool.

37
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:18,545
That's the solution.

38
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:25,190
Clean one customer type one, clear
flow, solo founder, viable rid

39
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,930
Well is a little more complex.

40
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:31,945
They have two customer types, households
who want to recycle hard to recycle

41
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:36,703
items, and city waste partners who
need better recycling solutions.

42
00:02:37,232 --> 00:02:41,643
Each type has different jobs to be
done, different value propositions.

43
00:02:41,643 --> 00:02:44,862
The household customer wants convenience.

44
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:46,417
And environmental impact.

45
00:02:46,726 --> 00:02:50,991
The city partner wants cost
reduction and sustainability metrics.

46
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,231
Two distinct flows that
have to work together.

47
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:56,781
Does rid, well need this complexity?

48
00:02:57,141 --> 00:03:02,547
Probably their model requires it,
so will have gone in eyes opened

49
00:03:02,847 --> 00:03:06,567
knowing they have to validate and
serve two different customer types.

50
00:03:06,956 --> 00:03:08,673
If you are adding a second.

51
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:13,893
Or more customer types, ask hard questions
about whether you really need it.

52
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,722
Sometimes you do just understand you're
signing up for multiple work and risk

53
00:03:20,764 --> 00:03:24,964
When you're choosing customer segments
as a solo or small venture, you'll

54
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:25,984
probably face some constraints.

55
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:27,800
Channel constraints.

56
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,550
For example, a solo founder
will find it hard to do high

57
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,350
touch enterprise sales calls.

58
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,140
You won't be able to afford a sales team.

59
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:40,798
You need customers who can find
you through content  marketing, SEO

60
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:46,738
community, word of mouth, channels that
can automate or scale with you, without

61
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:48,838
you needing to be everywhere at once.

62
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,172
Choose customers who value small.

63
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:55,017
Some segments actively
prefer solo or small teams.

64
00:03:55,083 --> 00:04:00,046
They get faster response times, more
specialized expertise, personal touch.

65
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,710
want the appearance of a big company.

66
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,401
Pick segments that work with what you are.

67
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,291
Look for async
communication opportunities.

68
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:13,871
You can't be available 24 7.

69
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:17,951
Customers who expect instant
support or constant handholding

70
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:19,451
are tough to serve solo.

71
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:22,973
Choose segments and use
cases where asynchronous

72
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:24,857
communication can be accepted.

73
00:04:26,694 --> 00:04:30,234
Not all P two P Ventures will have
well developed purpose narratives.

74
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:34,634
You might be doing this for yourself
and your family, and that story might

75
00:04:34,634 --> 00:04:38,826
not strengthen your business model
beyond improving your own motivation.

76
00:04:39,293 --> 00:04:43,285
But if your purpose can play a role in
the attractiveness of your solution, the

77
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:44,820
customer model is where this shows up.

78
00:04:45,877 --> 00:04:51,936
our example of Buy Me Once, the desire for
sustainable products is the core engine

79
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:56,384
of value creation for customers, it also
delivers the impact model for the venture.

80
00:04:56,841 --> 00:05:00,623
Purpose is integral to the
value proposition that drives

81
00:05:00,623 --> 00:05:01,763
the customers to engage.

82
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:05,793
For plausible analytics, their
mission to solve surveillance

83
00:05:05,793 --> 00:05:10,009
capitalism problems folds directly
into their value proposition as well.

84
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:14,824
Privacy without sacrifice, and
transparency through open source.

85
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:19,179
If your authentic voice and commitment
to purpose can strengthen your

86
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:21,154
value proposition, lean into it.

87
00:05:21,514 --> 00:05:22,834
If not, that's fine too.

88
00:05:23,787 --> 00:05:28,317
Modern AI and digital tools make solo
customer models viable in ways that

89
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:29,967
they just weren't five years ago.

90
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:34,743
Content creation, customer
research, marketing, logistics.

91
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:39,295
You can leverage tools to do work
that used to require whole teams.

92
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:42,924
We'll dive deeper into the specific
tools and approaches in module

93
00:05:42,924 --> 00:05:45,916
two, where we'll be working on
improving your business model.

94
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:49,156
But for now, just know that
being solo doesn't mean you

95
00:05:49,156 --> 00:05:50,626
have to do everything manually.

96
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,429
So keep it simple on your
first pass of the canvas.

97
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:55,899
Get the basics down.

98
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:59,300
Customers jobs, value
proposition solution.

99
00:05:59,838 --> 00:06:04,325
adding multiple customer types, pause
and ask if you really need them.

100
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,665
The complexity might be necessary,
but go in with your eyes open.

101
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,441
Okay, check out the P two P
library to see how different

102
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:14,391
ventures map their customer models.

103
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:18,019
The core example library has
additional examples showing various

104
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,411
different approaches as well.
