## Section 5: Conclusion

**Tag line: "Your business model, ready to test"**

### What You've Accomplished

You have just completed an important piece of work. Assessing and improving your customer, impact and economic models and having them integrated into a complete Social Lean Canvas model gives you a solid foundation upon which to validate.

### What You Know Now

Let's recap what you should know at this point.

For your **Customer Model**, you can clearly articulate your beachhead customer segment. You know your TAM times ARPU and whether it's enough. You understand the flow from customer segment to job to be done to unique value proposition to solution. You can see the path to product-market fit.

`[MAIN PANEL: Highlight Customer Model section]`

For your **Impact Model**, you have a clear causal chain from activities through outcomes to impact. You've tested the logic with experts and people with lived experience. And you understand the larger system you're operating in and where the most efficient intervention points are. 

`[MAIN PANEL: Highlight Impact Model section]`

For your **Economic Model**, you can demonstrate positive unit economics, even if it's still just approximate. You know your breakeven point and the path to get there. You understand what needs to be validated in your channels to reach enough customers. And you've identified at least one form of leverage in your model.

`[VISUAL TEXT: PMF path clear | impact logic tested | positive unit economics]`

And you've documented your core assumptions for each model. You know what you need to validate.



### Stage-Appropriate Depth

Now, all ventures are different. And all stages are different.

If you're at Idea stage, you don't need massive amounts of detail in your canvas to move forward. You're not expected to have everything figured out.

But you do need to be beyond back-of-napkin thinking.

`[VISUAL TEXT: beyond back-of-napkin | confident enough to start]`

The standard is this: Are you confident enough to start?

Not "Is this perfect?" But "Is this good enough to test?"

Not "Do I have all the answers?" But "Do I understand what needs to be validated?"

If you can answer yes to those questions, you're ready.

If you're at a later stage or have been through this improvement/validation loop several times already, you will need more detail because you will have a more refined understanding of your business model and the things you need to test next.

The goal is appropriate depth for where you are. Good enough to take the next step, whatever that next step is for you.

### Multiple Canvases

And if you've discovered multiple promising directions while improving your business model - that's good.

Having two or three alternative canvases to explore is smart. It means you've done the work to identify real opportunities.

Your strategy phase will help you prioritize which to validate first. Or you might validate multiple in parallel if your resources allow.

The point is: you have options, and they're all grounded in solid thinking.

### From Model to Action - And Back Again

You now have one or more business models worth testing. Next, you'll turn this into a clear, coherent strategy.

Strategy is how you validate your assumptions and move forward. It's how you turn your business model into action.


Time to test your model in the real world.

1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:04,153
You've just completed an important piece
of work,  Assessing and improving your

2
00:00:04,153 --> 00:00:08,594
customer impact and economic models and
having them integrated into a complete

3
00:00:08,594 --> 00:00:12,864
social lean canvas that's good enough to
validate, gives you a solid foundation.

4
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:15,411
Let's recap what you
should know at this point.

5
00:00:16,241 --> 00:00:18,900
For your customer model, you
can clearly articulate your

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,310
beachhead customer segment.

7
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:24,085
you know, roughly your tams times
arpu, and whether that looks like

8
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:28,244
enough, You understand the flow from
customer segments to jobs to be done,

9
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:30,609
to unique value proposition to solution.

10
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:35,284
You can see a path to product
market fit  for your impact model.

11
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:39,994
You have a clear causal chain from
activities through outcomes to impact.

12
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:44,495
You've tested the logic with experts
and people with lived experience, and

13
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:48,005
you understand the larger system you
are operating in and what the most

14
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:49,565
efficient intervention points might be.

15
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,619
For your economic model, you can
demonstrate positive unit economics are

16
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:56,689
possible, even if it's still approximate.

17
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:59,135
You know what your break
even point might be.

18
00:00:59,403 --> 00:01:02,392
You understand how your channels
are gonna work to each customers,

19
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:05,428
and you've identified at least one
form of leverage in your model,

20
00:01:06,177 --> 00:01:09,605
and hopefully you've documented your
core assumptions for each model.

21
00:01:09,732 --> 00:01:12,366
This will help you figure out
what needs to be validated.

22
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:17,443
Now all ventures are different and all
stages of development are different too.

23
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:21,534
If you're at idea stage, You don't
need massive amounts of detail

24
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:22,914
in your canvas to move forward.

25
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:25,411
You're not expected to have
everything figured out.

26
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:28,421
But you do need to be beyond
back of the napkin thinking

27
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:32,775
If you're at a later stage or have been
through this improvement validation

28
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:36,586
loop several times already, you'll need
more detail because you'll have a more

29
00:01:36,586 --> 00:01:40,520
refined understanding of your business
model the things that you need to test.

30
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,659
So whatever stage you're at, the goal
here is appropriate depth for where you

31
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,881
are good enough to take your next step.

32
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:49,651
Whatever that next step is for you.

33
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:54,320
If you've discovered multiple
promising directions while improving

34
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,195
your business model, that's good.

35
00:01:56,663 --> 00:01:59,963
Having two or three alternative
canvases to explore is smart.

36
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:02,397
It means you've done work
identifying real opportunities.

37
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:08,428
Your strategy phase will help you
prioritize which to validate first,  Or

38
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:12,153
you might validate multiple canvases
in parallel if your resources allow.

39
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:16,385
The point is you have options and
they're all grounded in solid thinking.

40
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:19,523
You now have one or more
business models worth testing.

41
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:22,906
Next, you'll turn this into
a clear, coherent strategy.
