- In **2018 he moved to Taiwan** with no set plan, doubling down on writing and a life experiment. ([“Go Wander (Abroad, Ideally)”](https://newsletter.pathlesspath.com/p/go-wander-abroad-ideally-224)) 
    
- Self-published **The Pathless Path** in **Jan 2022**; now positioned as a **65k+ copies** seller. ([Book site](https://pathlesspath.com/) • [How I sold 65k](https://pathlesspath.com/marketing/))

## **Why it’s relevant to SLC (solo-preneur with purpose)**
