# Assess Your Impact Model

Let's assess where your model might be weak. We'll look through four lenses.

### Fill in the Detail

If your impact model is still a rough sketch, flesh out enough of it so you can see and discuss how it works.

At this stage, you don't need every detail. But you need enough specificity to test the logic. You need to be able to explain: "We do these activities with these participants, which creates these short-term outcomes, which build to these medium-term outcomes, which over time generate these long-term outcomes and this ultimate impact."

You'll validate this later, but it has to look like it could work. It has to seem realistic on paper anyway.

### 1. Test the Logic

Does the causal chain actually hold up?

Start with the issue. Is this what you really think it is? Have you accurately diagnosed the problem, or are you addressing a symptom rather than a root cause?

Then the participants. Will they respond the way you expect them to? Are you making assumptions about their motivations, their capacity, their willingness to engage?

Then the activities. Will these actions actually generate the chain of outcomes you predict?

`[VISUAL TEXT: issue correct? | participants respond? | activities work?]`

Do research to test this logic. What have others learned? What does the academic literature say? What do experts in your field observe?

And be honest about what you don't know. It's better to identify weak logic now than to discover it after you've invested time and money.

### 2. Systems Thinking and Complexity Science Lens

Nothing happens in isolation. In the past, there have been many failures where people tried to solve a problem in isolation, only to have it backfire spectacularly.

You need to see the bigger picture. Use both systems thinking and complexity science perspectives.

**Systems thinking asks:**

What is the larger system your impact operates within? Your issue doesn't exist in a vacuum. What surrounds it?

What different factors contribute to the problem? Multiple causes, multiple influences, multiple actors.

What activities will drive long-term impact on this issue? Both the activities your impact model will implement and those that others will do that share influence on the issue.

What unintended consequences could result from your activities? Systems are interconnected. Pull one lever and something predictable happens elsewhere.

**Complexity science adds:**

Systems are dynamic, non-linear, and adaptive. They don't behave in simple cause-and-effect ways.

Small interventions in the right places can create outsized change. These are called leverage points in the system.

Emergent properties means you can't predict outcomes just from looking at activities/inputs alone. The whole system creates results that are more than the sum of its parts.

Feedback loops show how outcomes reinforce or dampen activities over time. Virtuous cycles or vicious cycles.

Tony's Chocolonely in the example library demonstrates this well. They're not just working with individual farmers. They're intervening at multiple points in the cocoa system - digital tracking, premium pricing, transparency campaigns, industry advocacy, licensing their model to competitors. Each creates leverage. Together they're trying to drive systemic industry transformation.

### 3. Efficiency Lens

Is your impact model the most effective and efficient way to generate the outcomes you're trying to achieve?

Sometimes we get so enamored with our ideas that we miss better approaches.

A counter-intuitive example came out of a domestic violence program that spent years working with women victims. They invested in helping them build support groups. Learn to sew. Start small businesses. They tried many different interventions.

But in the end, they figured out that helping their husbands find jobs was the most efficient way to reduce the harm these women were suffering and create positive long-term outcomes.

`[VISUAL TEXT: years of victim services → husband employment = most efficient]`

The intervention that actually worked was upstream and adjacent to the obvious solution. Not what they expected. But more effective and more efficient. 

Use this efficiency lens. Ask yourself:

What's the root cause you're actually addressing?

Are there more efficient intervention points in the system?

Are your activities FEELING impactful but not actually driving longterm change?

This efficiency lens connects to your economic model as well: more efficient impact activities means better economics. If you can achieve the same outcomes with fewer activities, lower costs, simpler delivery - your business model becomes stronger.

Toast Ale shows this well. Rather than running education campaigns about food waste, they intervene at the recovery point - turning surplus bread into beer. Direct waste reduction, immediate emissions avoided, and they fund environmental charities with the profits. Check out their impact model in the example library.

### 4. Third Party Perspective

Get outside perspectives on all these assessment angles.

Talk with advisors and experts in your impact area. But critically, talk with people who have lived experience of the issues you're approaching.

`[VISUAL TEXT: advisors | experts | lived experience]`

People with lived experience have deep insights that might be non-obvious. Perspectives you can't get any other way. Their input is critical.

Also talk with organizations already doing similar work. They'll have learned things that can save you years of struggle.

Ask, where are the weaknesses in my model? What am I missing? What would you do differently?

It's a red flag if you are only getting input from people who think like you. You need perspectives that challenge your assumptions.
