Now you're about to work through the Core content on the Economic Model. This shows how your enterprise turns the value you create for customers into an engine that powers your whole venture—your business and your impact.

The Core Framework walks through channels, revenue, costs, and advantage. How you reach customers at scale, how money works in your model, and where your leverage comes from.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Channels | Revenue | Costs | Advantage]**

After the Core content, we'll come back and talk about what economic models look like for P2P Ventures—solo or small team operations with fundamentally different cost structures and leverage points.

**Tag line:** **Economics at scale.**

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Economic Model for PPVs"]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just showed you how the economic model works—channels, revenue, costs, and advantage. Now let's talk about what this looks like for a venture like yours.

For for P2P ventures, the economic model can look significantly different from high growth startups or large social enterprises. Every venture will be different, but here are some principles to guide building an economic model that will work for your venture at your scale. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Different economics | P2P principles]**

### Channels for Solo/Small Teams

**[MAIN PANEL: Channel types - What works vs. What doesn't]**

Channels—how you reach and serve customers—matter differently for P2P ventures. Your constraints shape which channels will work well for your business model. 

Like we discussed in customer model, you probably can't afford a direct sales team. And you won't be able to do high-touch enterprise sales where you're on calls all day. You also likely won't be able afford expensive paid acquisition channels at scale. These all require resources you probably won't have.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Can't do | Direct sales | High-touch | Expensive acquisition]**

What does work for p2p scale? 
- Content-driven channels. SEO, blog posts, YouTube, AI discovery. 
- Community and word-of-mouth acquisition where customers you have bring you more customers. 
- Self-serve digital channels. 
- Curation platforms like Product Hunt, app stores and marketplaces.
- Strategic partnerships that don't require constant input and management.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Works | Content | Community | Self-serve | Platforms]**

Here's the key test: "Can this channel work while you sleep?" You need async, automated, or community-driven channels. You can't be manually selling every customer or you'll never scale beyond your own time.

**Tag line:** **Async channels win.**

### Revenue Models That Work Solo

**[MAIN PANEL: Revenue model comparison]**

Some revenue models work better than others when you're on your own.

**Subscription revenue** is predictable and recurring and it compounds over time. You build the product once, and revenue keeps coming in month after month. Each new customer adds to your base.

One-time sales can be lumpy. They require constant customer acquisition. You're always hunting the next sale. Revenue spikes when you sell, then drops until you sell again.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Subscriptions | Recurring | Predictable vs. One-time | Lumpy | Constant hustle]**

Beware revenue models that require constant manual work. Consulting hours, one-off services, custom builds. These don't scale—you're just selling your time. When you stop working, revenue stops.

Look for models with compounding effects. Each customer adds to the base. Each piece of content brings more organic traffic. Each community member attracts more members. You're building an engine, not just making individual sales.

**Tag line:** **Recurring beats one-time.**


---

### Keep Costs Lean

**[MAIN PANEL: Cost comparison - Traditional vs. P2P]**

Let's talk about cost structure. P2P cost models are generally leaner than traditional ventures.

No office. No staff initially. You're using cloud based infrastructure. AI tools instead of hiring. Outsourcing or automating work that doesn't need your direct touch.

**[VISUAL TEXT: No office | Cloud tools | AI augments | Lean baseline]**

This lean baseline creates two advantages. First, you can validate your model while still employed, because you can achieve more with less. Second, your revenue doesn't need to be massive to be sustainable.

Once there up and running, a traditional startup might need $50k or more in monthly revenue just to cover basic overheads—office, staff, benefits, all of it. A P2P venture might need just $5k per month to be viable, because the cost structure is so much leaner.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Lower overhead = Lower revenue threshold]**

This changes what "scale" means for you. You're not trying to support 20 employees and an office lease. You're trying to support yourself and build something sustainable. It's a different game entirely.

**Tag line:** **Lean by design.**

### Finding Your Leverage (Advantage)

**[MAIN PANEL: Leverage types diagram]**

The Core Framework showed you the advantage section—where you identify the leverage that makes your model work. For P2P ventures, certain types of leverage are particularly powerful.

These include - 
**Productization**: One-to-many instead of one-to-one. Courses instead of one-on-one consulting. SaaS instead of custom development. You build it once, then sell it many times. Your work compounds.

**Automation replacing manual work**: Customer support handled by AI chatbots. Automated onboarding sequences. Email workflows that nurture customers without you having touch each one. AI handling tasks that used to need people.

**Low or zero marginal costs digital products**: like software as a service - Each additional customer costs almost nothing to serve. Your tenth customer costs the same to serve as your thousandth.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Productization | Automation | Zero marginal cost]**

**Building on top of existing digital platforms** -   Shopify, Substack, Stripe. They handle infrastructure, payments, hosting and security. You can focus on your core value creation, and they handle everything else.

**Community as growth engine**: Members recruit other members. They create content. They provide support to each other. The community becomes the acquisition channel and the support system.

**Personal brand as your moat**: You can't be replicated. Your authentic voice, your specific expertise, your unique perspective—that's an advantage to leverage. No one else can be you.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Platform leverage | Community engine | Personal brand]**

Let's look at an example:

**[MAIN PANEL: Plausible Analytics economic model]**

Plausible Analytics shows what clean P2P venture economics look like in practice.

**Channels**: 
- Self-serve digital signup. No sales team. 
- Content marketing through blog posts about privacy and web analytics. 
- Word-of-mouth in developer communities where people share tools they love.

**Revenue**: 
- Subscription model. 
- Recurring monthly revenue per customer. 
- Plans from $9 to $150+ per month depending on traffic volume.

**Costs**: 
- Cloud hosting for the infrastructure.
- Time contributed by the founders.
- Minimal overhead beyond that.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Self-serve | Subscriptions | Cloud costs | Lean]**

**Advantage**: There leverage shows up in several places:
- Low marginal costs—it's a SaaS model, so each additional customer costs pennies in hosting to serve.
- Platform leverage—they built on existing cloud infrastructure rather than managing their own servers.
- Personal brand—the founders built reputation in the privacy and open-source space. People trust them.
- Product differentiation—they offer a simple, privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics. They have very clear positioning.

They don't need millions of customers to succeed. A few thousand paying subscribers at $9 to $19 per month creates a sustainable business for a small team. That's the power of the right economic model.

### Use the Typology and AI Tools

**[MAIN PANEL: Venture typology categories]**

The Venture Typology shows different economic model patterns across the six categories. Software & AI ventures have different economics than Local & Regenerative ventures. Different cost structures, different revenue models, different sources of leverage.

Browse through the typology to see patterns that might fit your model. See how ventures similar to yours have structured their economics.

**[VISUAL TEXT: 6 categories | Different economics | Pattern recognition]**

Use AI tools to explore your economic model. You can prompt LLMs for monetization strategies you haven't considered. Channel ideas specific to your venture type. Ways to optimize costs. Leverage points you might be missing.

AI is good at pattern matching and brainstorming—so use AI tools to expand what you're considering beyond your first ideas.

**Tag line:** **Explore patterns.**

### Practical Guidance

**[MAIN PANEL: Economic Model sections on canvas]**

Keep it high-level on this first pass through the canvas. Main channels, key revenue streams, major costs, primary leverage points. Just the shape of your economic model.

We'll go deeper in Module 2 where you'll improve your whole business model. There's detailed economic model work coming—pricing strategies, customer acquisition cost, lifetime value, unit economics, all of that. For now, just sketch the outline so you can see if the basic structure holds together.

**[VISUAL TEXT: High-level first | Details in Section 4]**

Check the P2P Example Library for different economic model approaches. The Core Example Library shows comprehensive models across different venture types and scales as well.

Document what you have in your canvas. This becomes your economic hypothesis—the model you'll test and refine as you validate.
