## P2P FRAMING

**[MAIN PANEL: Venture Stage Map diagram]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
You're about to work through the Core content on stage assessment. This introduces the Venture Stage Map - a framework that helps you understand where you are on the venture development journey.

The Core Framework breaks the journey into four stages: Idea, Early, Growth, and Scale. It shows how to assess progress across four dimensions: Customer Model, Impact Model, Economic Model, and Organization.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Idea → Early → Growth → Scale | Four dimensions]**

This framework applies to all ventures. After the Core content, we'll talk about what stage progression looks like specifically for Purpose Pivot Ventures.

**Tag line:** **Map your journey.**

## P2P COMMENTARY

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Stage Assessment for PPVs"]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just walked you through the Venture Stage Map and how to assess where you are across the four dimensions.

Now let's talk about what this looks like for Purpose Pivot Ventures.

**Tag line:** **P2P stage progression.**

### Same Stages, Scaled Down

**[MAIN PANEL: Side-by-side comparison of funded venture vs. PPV progression]**

First, understand this: the stages are the same for everyone. Idea to Early to Growth to Scale. This journey is universal.

What's different for p2p ventures is the scale of execution.

What a team of five does with $500k funding, you might do solo with $5k from savings. What takes a funded startup six months of full-time work might take you eighteen months while still employed.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Same journey | Different scale | Your pace is valid]**

The stages describe the maturity and validation of your business model, not the size of your team or the amount of capital you've raised.

You can be at Early stage with a solo operation validated through customer conversations and small pilots. You don't need a team of ten and $100k raised to reach Early stage. You just need the validation work done, and this will require more or less funding and team size depending on the particulars of your business model. 

**Tag line:** **Scale fits your context.**

### Examples from the Library

**[MAIN PANEL: Three example ventures side by side]**

Let's look at how this could play out using some examples from the p2p example library. Again, we are playing with these examples to help us understand how these p2p business models behave, not describing how they actually did it. 

**Plausible Analytics** - Software & AI category. For this kind of business model,Two founders could validate and build to Early stage with no external funding and minimal infrastructure. They could validated customer need through conversations, built an MVP themselves, got early paying customers, all while working from home with cloud infrastructure. Low organizational commitment. Fast path to revenue proof.

**DesignJoy** - Productized Services category. For this business model, a solo founder could get revenue proof quickly through direct client work, then systematize into a subscription design service. Organizational needs would stay minimal through Early stage - just the founder and eventually some contractors. They validate the full model through Early stage and into growth stage before needing any significant infrastructure.

**Linking Your Thinking** - Content, Education & Community category. A solo found building in public through content could validate audience interest and willingness to pay through newsletter and early workshops. Organizational commitment staying light - one person creating content and running cohorts. Impact model of helping people think better validated through testimonials and community engagement. Revenue proof from workshop sales before building any complex infrastructure.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Validate solo | Revenue proof fast | Minimal org needs]**

Notice the pattern. These business models let you progress from Idea stage through Early stage without requiring teams, offices, or significant capital. The validation work is doable solo or with a tiny team.

That's what makes them P2P-appropriate business models.

**Tag line:** **Examples show the way.**

### Your Stage Assessment

**[MAIN PANEL: Blank Venture Stage Map]**

Now assess your own venture using the Stage Map framework.

Look across all four dimensions. Where is your Customer Model? Your Impact Model? Your Economic Model? Your Organization?

If you're still employed and working on this part-time, you're probably at Idea stage organizationally. That's normal and good. You don't need to quit your job to make progress on validation.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Assess all four | Imbalance is normal early | Progress is progress]**

If your models are at different stages, that's okay. It's common. 

The important thing is understanding where you are so you can plan what to validate next to realign the three models and keep them moving forward together. 


**Tag line:** **Know your starting point.**

### Ready for Validation

**[MAIN PANEL: Transition to Validation section]**

You know where you are now. Time to figure out how to move forward.

That's what validation is for. Testing your riskiest assumptions systematically so you can progress through stages with confidence.

Let's dive into validation.
