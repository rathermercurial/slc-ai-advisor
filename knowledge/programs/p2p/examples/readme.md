# P2P Program Venture Examples

Real-world venture examples demonstrating how solo founders and small teams apply the Social Lean Canvas framework. These examples showcase P2P-specific patterns: simple customer models, bootstrapped funding, async-friendly channels, and AI-augmented solo operation.

## Overview

The P2P example library contains **7 venture examples** organized by business model archetype, plus 3 standalone examples. Each demonstrates solo/small-team viability and purpose-aligned business models.

**File Formats:**

- **Folder-based:** 3-4 files per venture (SLC + Impact Model + Report + optional overview)
- **Standalone:** Single .md files for brief examples

**Purpose:** Help solo founders see how ventures like theirs have structured Customer, Impact, and Economic models while maintaining simplicity and solo-operability. Allow AI agent to research specific examples to suggest to users or use examples to inform advice given to users.

## How to Use This Library

### For the AI Advisor

**P2P-Specific Filtering:**
When serving P2P users, filter examples by:

1. **Solo-Viability Indicators:**

   - Bootstrapped funding
   - Simple customer models (1-2 customer types max)
   - Content/SEO/community channels (not high-touch sales)
   - Subscription/product revenue (not complex multi-party)
   - Small team size (1-5 people)

2. **P2P Archetypes:**

   - Software & AI (vertical micro-SaaS)
   - Productized Services (DaaS, subscription services)
   - Consulting & Coaching (specialized expertise)
   - Content, Education & Community (membership models)
   - Digital Goods & Commerce (e-commerce, digital products)
   - Local, Regenerative & Physical (local-first, circular economy)

3. **Selection Matrix Dimensions:**
   - Stage: growth-stage, scale-stage (rarely idea-stage or early-stage examples)
   - Mechanism: product-service-impact, education-awareness...
   - Legal: standard-limited-company, benefit-corporation...
   - Revenue: subscriptions, product-sales, membership-dues...
   - Funding: bootstrapped, impact-equity...
   - Industry: ict, retail, education, consulting...

**Matching Strategy:**

- Prioritize archetype match over other dimensions
- "I'm building a SaaS product" → Plausible Analytics
- "I'm doing design services" → Design Joy
- "I want to teach/educate" → Ness Labs, Linking Your Thinking, The Pathless Path
- "E-commerce for purpose" → Buy Me Once, Ridwell

**P2P Themes to Highlight:**

- **1,000 True Fans:** Small viable audiences (Ness Labs: 5,000 members)
- **Simplicity:** Single customer type (Plausible Analytics)
- **Async Channels:** Content marketing, SEO, community (not sales teams)
- **AI Augmentation:** Tools enabling solo operation
- **Purpose Integration:** Mission as competitive advantage

### For Solo Founders

**Finding Similar Ventures:**

1. **Identify your archetype** (Software? Services? Content? Commerce?)
2. **Look for matching examples** in that category
3. **Study their customer model** - How simple is it? One customer type or multiple?
4. **Examine their channels** - Are they solo-friendly? (content, SEO, community)
5. **Review their economic model** - Sustainable with small team?

**Learning Focus:**

- **Simplicity:** How ventures keep models solo-operable
- **Channel Strategy:** Scalable customer acquisition without sales teams
- **Revenue Models:** Recurring vs. transactional, what works solo
- **Complexity Trade-offs:** When ventures accept complexity (like Ridwell's 2 customer types) and why

## Example File Structure

### Folder-Based Examples (7 ventures)

2. **{venture}-impact-model.md** - 7-step causality chain
3. **{venture}-report.md** - Analysis, context, learnings
4. **{venture}.md** (optional) - Brief overview or additional notes

### Standalone Examples (3 ventures)

Single .md files with condensed information:

- `the-generalist.md`

**Known Issue:** Inconsistent format (some ventures have folders, some are standalone). Consider standardizing to all folders or documenting when to use each format.
