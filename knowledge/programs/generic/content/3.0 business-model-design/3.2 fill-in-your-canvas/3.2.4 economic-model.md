# **Economic model

### Overview  
EconomicModel.Overview


1. Once you have developed the first versions of your customer and impact models  it is time to lay out your economic model
    
2. Your economic model shows how your enterprise will take the value you create for your customers and turn it into an engine that will power the social value that is created by your impact model
    

3. Where your customer and impact models drilled in on the micro of understanding how you create value and change, starting with individuals,  your economic model will focus on scale
    
4. Now Scale doesn't necessarily mean that your enterprise needs to become huge. Sometimes small is the right size for achieving your goals, 
    
5. Scale here, is about understanding the dynamics by which your enterprise is going to operate at the size you need it to get to to achieve those goals.
    
6. Your economic model is going to unpack:
    

7. How you are going to reach and serve your customers at the scale you need. 
    
8. How your financial model will work to ensure that you are financially sustainable and (if it is one of your goals) Profitable
    
9. And Thirdly it is also going to be where you identify the key points of leverage that your business model is going to take advantage of in order for you to succeed
    

10. These components all need to hold together in a coherent model (your economic model), that you and your supporters can understand and have confidence in.
    

### Channels  
EconomicModel.Channels

1. Channels are how you enterprise connects with your customers at scale, and there are two distinct component to channels
    

2. Firstly the channels through which your customers find you and become your customers. These are known as your customer acquisition channels or marketing channels
    

3. They could be things like: online advertising, word of mouth, affiliate networks, print advertising, store frontage etc.
    

4. The second component of channels covers how your product or service gets to your customers. These are known as your distribution channels.
    

5. They could be things like: a retail location, courier delivery, delivery through an online platform (like amazon), physical classroom delivery, sales through a distribution partner etc  
    

6. Both of these these things are crucial to understanding how your economic model will work at scale.
    

7. You will need to be able to prove that your channels will be effective at providing what your business model needs
    
8. Also channels usually incur significant costs, so you need to be able to model these costs to feed into your financial model
    

  

### Financial model   
EconomicModel.FinancialModel.Intro

1. The revenue and costs components of your economic model, come together to form the beginnings of your Financial model - this shows the way money works for your enterprise at scale.
    
2. This is about proving that the revenue that you get from your customers will be enough to cover the cost of delivering your product or service to your customers, as well as delivering the activities that your Impact model requires
    

3. This will show that your business model works as a single whole integrated system. That all of the pieces come together to create something that can at least sustain itself financially and turn a profit if that is your goal
    
4. In this first pass through the canvas, start by listing your business model's main revenue and cost items
    

###  Revenue  
    EconomicModel.FinancialModel.Revenue
    

6. For revenue, this will include all forms of regular income that your business model will generate.
    

7. This could be in the form of: Sales, Donations, Grants, Sponsorship and other forms of income.
    
8. But remember that we are looking to understand what your financial model looks like at scale. This is not about how you get there. So only include revenue that will be there when you are at scale, not things like the funding you will use in the startup phase.
    

### Costs  
    EconomicModel.FinancialModel.Costs
    

10. For costs this might include:
    

11. The costs involved with making your product or service
    
12. Marketing costs
    
13. Distribution costs
    
14. And the costs of delivering your impact activities
    
15. This will also include any other major ongoing costs that your business model will have to cover
    

16. Keep all of this simple and high-level to start with. This will give you the shape of your financial model and allow you to assess it's viability, as well as what might need to change about it.
    
17. Over time you will add in more detail as you move your enterprise forward and test the revenue and cost assumptions in this model
    

### Advantage  
EconomicModel.Advantage.1Leverage

1. The advantage section of your economic model is about understanding what is powerful about how your business model works
    
2. What is the leverage that is generated in your business model, that, when you reach the scale you are going for, will make your business model successful?
    
3. If there is no powerful advantage, you will not be able to make your revenue greater than your costs long term. That is... you won't be financially sustainable.
    
4. All businesses need to have one or more fundamental dynamics that make them work. It is possible to have a product that people want and will pay for, channels to reach customers through and the ability to deliver this at scale but to never be able to make the economics work. This is because there is not enough leverage in the business model. No matter how hard you try you just can't make your revenue greater than your costs. You need an advantage in the form of some type of leverage to make the difference.
    
5. This advantage could take be...
    

6. Owning a crucial piece of intellectual property that others don't have
    
7. Having access to a key resource at a discount or for free
    
8. Benefiting from powerful network effects
    
9. Having valuable brand associations - like a celebrity endorsement
    
10. Access to free or cheap capital - for example if there is impact investment that is available at better terms than your more commercial competitors can get
    
11. Or some other form of leverage.
    

Advantage 2  
EconomicModel.Advantage.2Innovate

1. The Advantage section of your canvas is often where you can innovate on your business model. It is the place where you can brainstorm how your business model can be improved by finding an advantage that you can build on. This is especially important if, after sketching your financial model, you find that the numbers don't really stack up.
    

  

### Example: Facebook  
EconomicModel.FB.Example.Overview

Let's walk through the example of Facebook to practice how to develop your economic model using Facebook. There isn't an impact component to consider for Facebook, but it will be a useful and familiar model to work through all the same

### Channels  
    EconomicModel.FB.Example.Channels
    

Firstly channels

1. Facebook's customer acquisition channel for its user customer type was mainly via viral word of mouth. People who became Facebook users then invited their friends and as each user invited, on average, more than one other user, customer numbers grew exponentially
    
2. For its advertiser customer type facebook used a direct sales channel, selling adds to businesses and later a self-serve digital sales channel.
    
3. Facebook's distribution channel was its online website application and later its mobile application
    

  

### Financial model  
    EconomicModel.FB.Example.FinancialModel
    

  For its financial model

The basics of Facebooks Revenue and Costs would look something like:

###  For revenue - 
x advertising dollars per user per hour of engagement. Then perhaps a projection of how much revenue they would expect at scale based on numbers of users and the average level of engagement from these users
    
### For costs 
- it would include things like:
    

3. Development costs to maintain and improve the product
    
4. Hosting and bandwidth costs for delivering the product
    
5. Sales costs for selling to advertising buyers
    
6. And other business and staffing costs
    

7. For this first pass through the canvas, we keep the numbers high-level and then develop the financial model in more detail over time.
    
8. The key important thing to understand in Facebook's financial model is... if the customer and impact models are both correct, can facebook succeed from a financial perspective?
    

###  Advantage  
    EconomicModel.FB.Example.Advantage
    

10. In the advantage section we are looking for the powerful business model dynamics that will cause Facebook to succeed
    
11. There are 2 main advantages here, 2 "forms of leverage" that makes facebook's business model so strong
    

12. Firstly they can grow incredibly quickly at almost zero cost. While other businesses have to recycle large amounts of their revenue back into acquiring expensive new customers, facebook's users did this job for them for free. They were able to grow to over 2 billion users without paying for customer acquisition the way other online businesses have to.
    
13. Their second main point of leverage was the network effects they generated - this is the dynamic by which the value of their service goes up with every new customer they add. The more people there are on facebook the more valuable it is to each user because there are more people that they can connect with.
    
14. Both of these points of leverage created an unstoppable advantage for facebook. They could add users very cheaply and quickly, and every new user they added made their platform better and better. This created a virtuous cycle that no other social network could compete with. 
    

economic model_overview.webm.01.srt
1
00:00:00,062 --> 00:00:04,262
Once you've developed the first version
of your customer and impact models, it's

2
00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:06,332
time to lay out your economic model.

3
00:00:06,992 --> 00:00:11,282
Your economic model shows how your
enterprise will take the value you create

4
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:15,992
for your customers and turn it into an
engine that will power the social value

5
00:00:15,992 --> 00:00:17,822
that's created by your impact model.

6
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:22,202
Where your customer and impact
models drilled in on the micro of

7
00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:26,222
understanding how you create value
and change starting with individuals,

8
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:29,462
your impact model will focus on scale.

9
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:34,112
Now, scale doesn't necessarily mean that
your enterprise needs to become huge.

10
00:00:34,322 --> 00:00:38,582
Sometimes small is the right size
for achieving your goals, but rather

11
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:42,122
it's about understanding the dynamics
by which your enterprise is going

12
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:46,622
to operate at the size it needs
to get to to achieve your goals.

13
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:51,407
Your economic model's gonna unpack
firstly, how you're gonna reach your

14
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:53,297
customers at the scale you need.

15
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:57,497
Secondly, how your financial model
will work to ensure that you're

16
00:00:57,497 --> 00:01:01,427
financially sustainable and if
it's one of your goals profitable.

17
00:01:02,507 --> 00:01:06,587
And thirdly, it's gonna be where you
identify the key points of leverage

18
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:11,087
that your business model is gonna take
advantage of in order for you to succeed.

19
00:01:12,287 --> 00:01:16,067
These components all need to hold
together in a coherent model.

20
00:01:16,187 --> 00:01:20,537
Your economic model that you and
your supporters can understand

21
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:21,677
and have confidence in.




economic model_channels.webm.01-1.srt
1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,610
Channels are how your enterprise connects
with your customers at scale, and there

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,800
are two distinct components to channels.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,460
Firstly, channels through
which your customer finds you

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,870
and becomes your customer.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,220
These are known as customer acquisition
channels or marketing channels.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,380
They could be things like online
advertising, word of mouth, affiliate

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,130
networks, print advertising,
store frontage, things like that.

8
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:29,645
The second component of channels
covers how your product or

9
00:00:29,645 --> 00:00:31,685
service gets to your customers.

10
00:00:32,495 --> 00:00:34,685
These are known as distribution channels.

11
00:00:34,925 --> 00:00:39,395
They could be things like a retail
location, courier delivery, delivery

12
00:00:39,395 --> 00:00:45,350
through an online platform like Amazon,
physical classroom delivery, sales through

13
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:47,675
a distribution partner, things like that.

14
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:51,815
Both of these things are crucial
to understanding how your

15
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:53,795
economic model will work at scale.

16
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:57,905
You will need to be able to prove that
your channels will be effective at

17
00:00:57,905 --> 00:01:00,035
providing what your business model needs.

18
00:01:00,545 --> 00:01:04,025
And also channels usually
incur significant cost.

19
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,595
So you'll need to be able to
model these costs and feed

20
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:09,005
them into your financial model.





economic model_financial model_intro.webm.01-1.srt
1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,900
The revenue and cost components of your
economic model come together to form

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,880
the beginnings of your financial model.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,290
This shows the way that money
works for your enterprise at scale.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,090
This is about proving that the revenue
that you get from your customers

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,020
will be enough to cover the cost of
delivering your product or service

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,610
to your customers, as well as the
cost of delivering the activities

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,620
that your impact model requires.

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,740
This will show that your
business model works as a

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,110
single, whole integrated system.

10
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:35,745
That all of the pieces come together
to create something that can at least

11
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:38,415
sustain itself and turn a profit.

12
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:42,855
If that's your goal in this first
pass through the canvas, start

13
00:00:42,855 --> 00:00:46,725
by listing your business model's
main revenue and cost items.






economic model_financial model_revenue.webm.01-1.srt
1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:00,789
for revenue.

2
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:03,489
This will include all forms
of regular income that your

3
00:00:03,489 --> 00:00:04,809
business model will generate.

4
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:09,129
This could be in the form of sales
donations, grants sponsorship,

5
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:10,629
and other forms of income.

6
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:14,799
But remember that we are looking here
to understand what your financial

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,569
model will look like at scale.

8
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:21,159
This is not about how you will
get there, so only include revenue

9
00:00:21,159 --> 00:00:24,789
that will be there when you're at
scale, not things like funding that

10
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,559
you will use in the startup phase.




economic model_financial model_costs.webm.01-1.srt
1
00:00:00,056 --> 00:00:00,896
for costs.

2
00:00:00,896 --> 00:00:05,876
This might include the costs involved with
making your product or service marketing

3
00:00:05,876 --> 00:00:11,216
costs, distribution costs, and the cost
of delivering your impact activities.

4
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:15,386
This will also include any other
major ongoing costs that your

5
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:16,766
business model will have to cover.

6
00:00:17,636 --> 00:00:20,396
Keep all of this simple and
high level to start with.

7
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:24,746
This will give you the shape of your
financial model and allow you to assess

8
00:00:24,746 --> 00:00:29,636
its viability as well as what might
need to change about it over time.

9
00:00:29,636 --> 00:00:32,486
You will add in more detail
as you move forward with your

10
00:00:32,486 --> 00:00:36,686
enterprise and test the revenue
and cost assumptions in this model.





economic model_advantage_1.webm.01.srt
1
00:00:00,053 --> 00:00:02,873
The advantage section of
your economic model is about

2
00:00:02,873 --> 00:00:06,773
understanding what is powerful
about how your business model works.

3
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,693
What is the leverage that is generated
in your business model that when you

4
00:00:11,693 --> 00:00:15,563
reach the scale you're going for will
make your business model successful.

5
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:20,663
If there is no powerful advantage, you
will not be able to make your revenue

6
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:22,583
greater than your costs long term.

7
00:00:22,973 --> 00:00:25,583
That is you won't be
financially sustainable.

8
00:00:26,513 --> 00:00:31,493
All businesses need to have one or more
fundamental dynamics that make them work.

9
00:00:32,693 --> 00:00:37,493
It is possible to have a product that
people want and will pay for channels to

10
00:00:37,493 --> 00:00:42,143
reach customers through, and the ability
to deliver this at scale, but to never

11
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:44,063
be able to make the economics work.

12
00:00:44,573 --> 00:00:47,813
This is because there's not enough
leverage in the business model.

13
00:00:48,353 --> 00:00:53,333
No matter how hard you try, you just can't
make your revenue greater than your costs.

14
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:58,403
You need an advantage in the form of some
type of leverage to make the difference.

15
00:00:59,948 --> 00:01:02,618
This advantage could take
many different forms.

16
00:01:02,678 --> 00:01:06,098
It could be owning a crucial
piece of intellectual property

17
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:07,688
that others don't have access to.

18
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:13,298
It could be having access to a key
resource at a discount, or for free,

19
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:19,418
benefiting from powerful network effects,
having valuable brand associations

20
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:20,978
like a celebrity endorsement.

21
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:24,098
Access to cheap or free capital.

22
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:28,148
For example, if there's an impact
investment that's available

23
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:31,358
on better terms than your more
commercial competitors can get

24
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:33,878
or some other form of leverage.





economic model_advantage_2 innovate.webm.01.srt
1
00:00:00,045 --> 00:00:03,225
The advantage section of your
canvas is often where you can

2
00:00:03,285 --> 00:00:04,755
innovate on your business model.

3
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:08,475
It's the place where you can
brainstorm how your business model

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,925
can be improved by finding an
advantage that you can build on.

5
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:17,565
This is especially important if after
sketching your financial model, you find

6
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:19,455
that the numbers don't really stack up.



economic model_FBexample_overview.webm.01-1.srt
1
00:00:00,065 --> 00:00:02,825
Let's walk through the example
of Facebook to practice how to

2
00:00:02,825 --> 00:00:04,265
develop your economic model.

3
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:08,885
There isn't an impact component
to consider for Facebook, but

4
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:12,035
it will be a useful and familiar
model to work through all the same




economic model_FBexample_channels.webm.01-1.srt
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,641
Firstly, channels, Facebook's customer
acquisition channel for its user.

2
00:00:04,641 --> 00:00:08,121
Customer type was mainly
via viral word of mouth.

3
00:00:08,631 --> 00:00:14,541
People who became Facebook users invited
their friends, and as each user invited,

4
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:19,041
on average, more than one other user,
customer numbers grew exponentially.

5
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:24,471
For its advertiser customer type,
Facebook used a direct sales channel

6
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:30,291
selling ads to businesses, and then later
a self-service digital sales channel.

7
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:35,721
Facebook's distribution channel
was its online website application,

8
00:00:35,991 --> 00:00:37,701
and later its mobile application.

1
00:00:00,073 --> 00:00:04,573
For its financial model, the basics of
Facebook's revenue and costs would look

2
00:00:04,573 --> 00:00:10,483
something like for revenue, X advertising,
dollars per user, per hour of engagement.

3
00:00:11,323 --> 00:00:16,333
Then perhaps a projection of how much
revenue they would expect at scale based

4
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:21,193
on the numbers of users and the average
level enga of engagement from these users.

5
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:26,983
For costs, it would include things like
development costs to maintain and improve

6
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:32,623
the product, hosting and bandwidth
costs for delivering the product, sales

7
00:00:32,623 --> 00:00:37,633
costs, for selling to advertising buyers
and other business and staffing costs.

8
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:41,493
For this first pass through the
canvas, we keep the numbers high

9
00:00:41,493 --> 00:00:45,693
level and then develop the financial
model in more detail over time.

10
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:49,563
The key important thing to
understand in Facebook's financial

11
00:00:49,563 --> 00:00:54,033
model is if the customer and
impact models are both correct.

12
00:00:54,423 --> 00:00:57,633
Can Facebook succeed from
a financial perspective?



economic model_FBexample_advantage.webm.01-1.srt

00:00:00,076 --> 00:00:04,186
In the advantage section, we are looking
for the powerful business model dynamics

2
00:00:04,186 --> 00:00:06,166
that will cause Facebook to succeed.

3
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:09,766
There are two main advantages
that Facebook had here.

4
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:13,351
Two forms of leverage that made
their business model so strong.

5
00:00:14,326 --> 00:00:18,676
Firstly, they can grow incredibly
quickly at almost zero cost.

6
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:22,786
While other businesses have to recycle
large amounts of their revenue back

7
00:00:22,786 --> 00:00:25,216
into acquiring expensive new customers.

8
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:28,786
Facebook's users did this
job for them for free.

9
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:33,826
They were able to grow to over 2
billion users without paying for

10
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:37,366
customer acquisition in the way that
other online businesses have to.

11
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:42,841
The second main point of leverage was
the network effects that they generated.

12
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:47,551
This is the dynamic by which the
value of their service goes up with

13
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,471
every new customer that they add.

14
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:55,141
The more people that are on Facebook,
the more valuable it is to each of

15
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:59,101
those users because there are more
possible people for them to connect with.

16
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:04,231
Both of these points of leverage created
an unstoppable advantage for Facebook.

17
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:09,841
They could add users very cheaply and
quickly, and every new user they added

18
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:11,611
made their platform better and better.

19
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:16,471
This created a virtuous cycle that no
other social network could compete with.
