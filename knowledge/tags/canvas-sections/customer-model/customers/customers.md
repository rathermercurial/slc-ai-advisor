# customers

## Definition
The `customers` tag identifies content about identifying and defining customers - the individuals or organizations essential to the enterprise's operation, including customer types and segments.

## Usage Criteria
Apply this tag to content that:
- Defines customer types vs. customer segments
- Provides guidance on customer identification
- Discusses customer categorization methodologies
- Analyzes customer definitions in case studies

## Always Include When
- Content focuses on customer identification and definition
- Customer segmentation methodologies
- Customer type categorization approaches
- Customer analysis in examples

## Never Include When
- Content is about early adopters specifically (use `early-adopters` instead)
- General marketing or sales content not tied to canvas framework
- Customer service content unrelated to customer definition

## Required Combinations
- Must include appropriate canvas-sections hierarchy: [customer-model, customers]
- Often combined with `early-adopters` when content covers both

## Content Examples
- Customer identification frameworks
- Customer type vs. segment distinctions
- Customer definition templates
- Customer analysis methodologies

## Related Tags
- Parent tags: [customer-model](../customer-model.md)
- Child tag: [early-adopters](early-adopters/early-adopters.md)
- Often appears with [jobs-to-be-done](../jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done.md) (customers and their jobs)
- May combine with `case-study` content tags for customer analysis examples

## Hierarchy
- [Early Adopters](early-adopters/early-adopters.md) - Specific subset of customers for initial validation

## Key Concepts
- Customer Types: Broad roles (users, buyers, funders)
- Customer Segments: Specific subgroups within types
- Multi-sided markets: Different customer types
- Customer/user/payer distinctions
