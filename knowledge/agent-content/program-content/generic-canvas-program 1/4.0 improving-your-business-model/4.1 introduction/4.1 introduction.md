### Before You Validate
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
Once you have your business model sketched out, the next step is to start validating it. But before creating a strategy to do that, you need to check that it's actually good enough to put time, money, and effort into.

And if it isn't, you need to improve it so that it is.

There is no point in spending time and effort to validate a business model that doesn't have - at least on paper - the potential to succeed.

### This happens so often. 

So often we see people struggling away for years on business models that were low potential from the start. These entrepreneurs would have been much better off casting a more critical eye over their business model at the beginning, and making crucial changes before they started doing all that work.

### What Makes a Good Business Model?

Back in Understanding Business Model Design, we outlined what a business mode is and how one works. In this module we are focused on trying to make your business model as good as it can be.

At this early stage, a high-potential business model needs have the following qualities:

Firstly - Your Customer Model has to have the potential to reach product-market fit.

Your Impact Model needs to show that it can deliver impact - both in the micro, short-term outcomes and in the macro, long-term impact.

And your Economic Model needs to show the potential for positive unit economics and growth.

### What This Module Covers

In this module, I'll walk through how to analyze each of these models. We'll assess whether they're strong enough. And if not, I'll walk you through how to improve them to make them stronger.
