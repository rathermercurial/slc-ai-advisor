# outputs

## Definition
The `outputs` tag identifies content about direct, immediate products of activities that can be counted and measured - the tangible deliverables produced through enterprise activities.

## Usage Criteria
Apply this tag to content that:
- Defines output identification and measurement
- Discusses output tracking methodologies
- Provides frameworks for output analysis
- Analyzes output-outcome relationships

## Always Include When
- Content focuses on output measurement and tracking
- Output identification frameworks
- Output-outcome logic analysis

## Never Include When
- Content about outcomes (use specific outcome tags)
- Activity content without output focus
- General productivity content not tied to impact model

## Required Combinations
- Must include appropriate canvas-sections hierarchy: [impact-model, outputs]

## Content Examples
- Output identification and measurement frameworks
- Activity-output tracking methodologies
- Output categorization and analysis approaches
- Output-outcome relationship mapping
