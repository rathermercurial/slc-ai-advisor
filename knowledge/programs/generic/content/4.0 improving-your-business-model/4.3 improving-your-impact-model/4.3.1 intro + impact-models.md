## Section 3: Improving Your Impact Model

**Tag line: "Make your theory of change real"**

### Bridge from Customer Model

Having worked through improving your customer model. Now let's focus on your impact model.

### A Note on Impact Methodologies

Before we dive in, an important caveat.

There are many different approaches to mapping and modeling impact. 

Depending on the field you're in and the partners you work with, there may be specific impact methodologies already being used.

If you're working in a context where a specific methodology is expected or required, use that approach. Consistency and context-specific relevance matter.

The model we use in the Social Lean Canvas the best general model. It is the most generally useful one across most contexts. But the improvement ideas that we are going to work through here are applicable to any model that you are using.

The idea is to have a solid approach without getting bogged down with too much detail. We're walking a line: developing an effective approach that's good enough to validate, without over investing in detail. 

### Quick Diagnostic Check

Let's start with a quick check. Ask yourself these questions about your impact model:

Can you clearly articulate the causal chain from your activities to outcomes to impact?

Does your logic hold up under scrutiny?

Is it realistic that your activities will generate the outcomes you predict?


`[VISUAL TEXT: clear causal chain? | logic holds? | micro + macro impact?]`

If you're hesitating on any of these, your impact model probably needs work. Red flags include vague outcome statements, fuzzy logic and surface level generalizations about the issue.



### Impact Model Fundamentals

Your impact model is the causal chain that shows how your work creates the impact you exist to create.

In the model we use for the social lean canvas it follows this structure:
1. You start with the Issue - the specific social or environmental problem you're addressing. 
2. Then Participants - the people directly involved in your activities. 
3. Then Activities - the actions taken by or with participants. 
4. These generate Short-term Outcomes, 
5. Which build into Medium-term Outcomes, 
6. Which create Long-term Outcomes, 
7. Which ultimately achieve your Impact - the sustained change that aligns with your purpose.

There are two layers you need to achieve:

**Micro impact** - immediate, measurable changes. Your activities generate short-term outcomes that you can see and track quickly.

**Macro impact** - sustained systemic change. Medium-term and long-term outcomes that build over years, creating lasting transformation.

`[VISUAL TEXT: micro = immediate changes | macro = systemic transformation]`

A common trap is focusing only on immediate outputs while neglecting long-term systemic change. Your impact model needs to show both.

Many of you will have a back-of-napkin impact model from your first pass through the canvas. That's fine. From here, you can tighten the model. If you're an existing nonprofit creating a social enterprise, you might already have a well-developed impact model. Either way, the goal is the same: get it good enough to start validating.
