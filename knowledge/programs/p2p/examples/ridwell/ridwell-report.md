# Ridwell Research Report

*Research conducted for Social Lean Canvas analysis*

## 1. Description

Ridwell was founded in 2017 by Ryan Metzger and initially developed with his son Owen as "Owen's List." The Seattle-based venture capital-backed startup provides subscription-based doorstep pickup services for hard-to-recycle household items like plastic film, batteries, light bulbs, textiles, and electronics. The company serves as a bridge between consumers who want to reduce landfill waste and specialized recycling/reuse partners who can process these materials responsibly. Operating across seven states with over 90,000 members, Ridwell's mission is to make responsible waste disposal simple while creating a sustainable business model around environmental impact.

## 2. Purpose

**Purpose Detailed Analysis**: Ridwell addresses the fundamental problem that many everyday household items cannot be properly recycled through municipal curbside programs, leading to unnecessary landfill waste and environmental degradation. The company was founded after Ryan Metzger struggled to find proper disposal options for dead batteries and realized this was a widespread community need. Ridwell's purpose centers on making waste reduction accessible and convenient while building a sustainable business that connects motivated consumers with vetted recycling and reuse partners.

**Purpose Synopsis**: Make responsible disposal of hard-to-recycle household items simple and accessible while reducing landfill waste.

## 3. Customer Model

### Customers

**Customer Types and Segments**:
- **Primary Customer Type**: Environmentally-conscious households
  - **Early Adopters**: Environmental activists and sustainability-focused families in Seattle neighborhoods (Queen Anne, Ballard, West Seattle, Capitol Hill have nearly 20% participation)
  - **Mainstream Adopters**: Families with disposal guilt seeking convenient solutions
  - **Convenience Seekers**: Busy households wanting simplified waste management

**Customers Detailed Analysis**: Ridwell primarily serves environmentally-motivated households who experience "disposal guilt" when throwing recyclable items in trash. These customers typically live in progressive urban areas, have disposable income ($14-24/month), and value convenience. Early adopters were neighbors in Seattle who joined Owen's List, demonstrating high environmental engagement. The customer base has expanded to include busy families who appreciate the simplified approach to responsible waste disposal across multiple metropolitan areas.

**Customers Synopsis**: Environmentally-conscious households seeking convenient solutions for hard-to-recycle household items.

### Jobs to be Done

**Jobs to be Done Detailed Analysis**: Customers hire Ridwell to reduce their environmental guilt and anxiety about waste disposal while maintaining convenience in their daily lives. The deeper psychological need is feeling like a responsible global citizen without the time investment of researching and driving to specialized recycling facilities. Customers want to "do the right thing" for future generations while living busy lives. This goes beyond simple waste disposal - it's about identity alignment and peace of mind.

**Jobs to be Done Synopsis**: Reduce environmental guilt while maintaining convenient household waste disposal without time-intensive research.

### Existing Alternatives

**Existing Alternatives Detailed Analysis**: Before Ridwell, customers had three main alternatives: throwing items in regular trash (easiest but guilt-inducing), spending time researching and driving to specialized recycling locations (time-consuming and inconvenient), or storing items indefinitely while procrastinating proper disposal. Municipal recycling programs don't handle most of Ridwell's categories, and many drop-off locations have limited hours or sporadic availability. TerraCycle offers similar services but with different operational approaches.

**Existing Alternatives Synopsis**: Throwing items in trash, driving to specialized recyclers, or indefinite storage while procrastinating disposal.

### Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

**UVP Detailed Analysis**: Ridwell's unique value lies in combining environmental responsibility with maximum convenience through doorstep pickup, while providing transparency about where items actually go. Unlike competitors, Ridwell offers regular scheduled pickups, transparent partner reporting, and handles the entire logistics chain. The service transforms a guilt-inducing chore into a positive environmental action that fits seamlessly into existing household routines. Members receive satisfaction from measurable environmental impact without lifestyle disruption.

**UVP Synopsis**: Guilt-free environmental impact through convenient scheduled doorstep pickup with full transparency about item destinations.

### Solution

**Solution Detailed Analysis**: Ridwell provides members with specialized bags and a collection bin for sorting different categories of hard-to-recycle items (plastic film, batteries, light bulbs, textiles, electronics). Professional drivers pickup items bi-weekly from members' doorsteps, then sort and transport materials to vetted recycling and reuse partners. The service includes text confirmations, impact reporting, and transparent communication about where items go, creating a complete end-to-end solution that removes all friction from responsible disposal.

**Solution Synopsis**: Subscription doorstep pickup service with provided bags, bi-weekly collection, and processing through vetted partners.

## 4. Impact Model

### Issue

**Issue Detailed Analysis**: Millions of tons of recyclable and reusable household items end up in landfills annually because municipal recycling programs don't accept them and proper disposal requires significant time and knowledge. This creates unnecessary environmental degradation, wasted resources, and widespread consumer frustration and guilt. The recycling system has gaps that leave environmentally-motivated individuals without accessible options for responsible disposal, contributing to climate change and resource depletion while causing psychological stress for consumers who want to act responsibly.

**Issue Synopsis**: Hard-to-recycle household items unnecessarily filling landfills due to system gaps and inconvenient disposal options.

### Participants

**Participants Detailed Analysis**: Key participants include Ridwell members (90,000+ households across seven states), Ridwell drivers and warehouse staff (200+ employees), over 200 recycling and reuse partner organizations (ranging from large manufacturers like Trex to local nonprofits like Make It Home), and ultimately the broader community that benefits from reduced landfill waste. Additional participants include investors who fund the operation and local governments in areas where Ridwell operates.

**Participants Synopsis**: Household members, Ridwell staff, 200+ recycling/reuse partners, and broader communities benefiting from waste reduction.

### Activities

**Activities Detailed Analysis**: Core activities include member households sorting items into provided bags, bi-weekly doorstep collection by trained drivers, warehouse sorting and quality control to maintain low contamination rates (2.7% vs 25% industry average), transportation to specialized partners, processing by partners into new products or reuse applications, and transparent reporting back to members about impact metrics. Each pickup cycle involves thousands of individual household collections coordinated across multiple metropolitan areas.

**Activities Synopsis**: Household sorting, bi-weekly doorstep collection, warehouse processing, and transportation to specialized recycling/reuse partners.

### Outcomes Chain

**Short-Term Outcomes**: Immediate diversion of hard-to-recycle items from household trash streams, reduced member anxiety about waste disposal, increased awareness of recycling possibilities in local communities.

**Medium-Term Outcomes**: Measurable reduction in landfill waste (15+ million pounds diverted to date), strengthened recycling/reuse partner network, expanded service areas reaching more households, normalized subscription-based waste services.

**Long-Term Outcomes**: Systemic reduction in unnecessary landfill waste, stronger circular economy infrastructure, policy changes supporting extended producer responsibility, cultural shift toward convenient environmental responsibility.

**Outcomes Detailed Analysis**: Ridwell creates immediate waste diversion and guilt relief for members, building toward larger systemic change in waste management. Medium-term outcomes include measurable environmental impact (15+ million pounds diverted) and infrastructure development through partner networks. Long-term outcomes envision policy changes, industry transformation, and cultural normalization of convenient environmental responsibility, contributing to broader circular economy development.

**Outcomes Synopsis**:
- **Short-term**: Items diverted from trash, reduced disposal guilt, increased recycling awareness
- **Medium-term**: Millions of pounds diverted, expanded partner networks, normalized subscription waste services  
- **Long-term**: Systemic waste reduction, stronger circular economy, policy changes supporting environmental responsibility

### Impact

**Impact Detailed Analysis**: The ultimate impact is a future where responsible disposal of all materials is as convenient and accessible as throwing items in trash, contributing to a circular economy where nothing valuable goes to waste. This involves both immediate environmental benefits (reduced landfill pressure, resource conservation) and systemic transformation of waste management culture and infrastructure. Ridwell's model demonstrates that environmental responsibility can be profitable and convenient, potentially inspiring policy changes and industry adoption of similar approaches.

**Impact Synopsis**: A future where responsible disposal is as convenient as trash, supporting a circular economy with minimal waste.
