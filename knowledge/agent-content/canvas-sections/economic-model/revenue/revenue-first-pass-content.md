### Revenue

For revenue, this will include all forms of regular income that your business model will generate. This could be in the form of sales, donations, grants, sponsorship, and other forms of income. But remember that we're looking here to understand what your financial model will look like at scale. This is not about how you will get there. So only include revenue that will be there when you're at scale. Not things like funding that you will use in the startup phase.
