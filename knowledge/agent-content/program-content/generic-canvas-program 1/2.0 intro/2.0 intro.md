**Elements:**

- Title: **The Social Lean Canvas**
    
- Tagline: _Turn your idea into a testable purpose-driven business model._

### **2. What this program does (short intro)**



- “Welcome to The Social Lean Canvas.”
    
- “This is where you take the ideas in your head and turn them into a clear, testable business model that can succeed.”
    
- “I’ll walk you through a set of simple steps to map what you know, suspect and haven’t yet articulated into a coherent model that fits on a single page.”
    
- “When you’ve completed your canvas you’ll have a one-page map of who you serve, how you create value, how you make money, and how you create impact.”
    

  
---

### **3. Who it’s for (short version)**

  

The Social Lean Canvas is for **purpose-driven ventures** – organisations that care about both:
- a **business model** – a money system that keeps the venture alive, and
- an **impact model** – a clear logic for the change you want to create in the world.

This can include social enterprises, community and indigenous ventures, co-operatives, non-profits with earned income, mission-led startups, solo ventures, and all the other, yet to be imagined ways we can use a business model to deliver social or environmental impact

If this is what you are working towards, then the social lean canvas is for you. 



---

### **4. What you’ll walk away with**

  

By the time you’ve finished Your Social Lean Canvas, you’ll have made sense of your ideas, you'll have:

- A **clear one-page map** of your venture – who you serve, how you create value, how you make money, and how you create impact.
    
- A **shared language** to talk about your idea with co-founders, funders, partners and supporters.
    
- And a **foundation** upon which you can build a clear strategy to take your venture forward.
  



---

### **5. Free & open + Build mention (one paragraph)**

  
The Social Lean Canvas is **free and open to everyone**
  

If, after you’ve done your canvas, you want more support to improve your model and design your strategy, there’s a follow-on program called **Build**. We charge a modest fee for Build to help sustain this work. But we also know that "modest fee" for one person could be a month's salary for another, so if you want to join Build but can’t afford it to pay for it, we've got you covered. No one misses out because of money.  

People who can pay for Build effectively **pay it forward** – helping fund places for those who can’t afford it, and keeping the Social Lean Canvas accessible to everyone who needs it.

### **7. Who uses the canvas (full version)**

  The Social Lean Canvas is for ventures that have **both**:

- a **business model** – a way to earn money to grow and sustain your venture
    
- an **impact model** – clear logic for how your activities will create positive change in the world
      

There are lots of different ways this can show up in the world. You might think of yourself as a **social enterprise**, a **community or indigenous enterprise**, a **co-operative**, a **non-profit with earned income**, or a **mission-led startup or solo venture of some sort**. All of these have a mechanism for money to flow through them to make them financially sustainable, and even profitable, while having a social or environmental mission. All can work on the canvas.

  We’ve deliberately designed the SLC so it isn’t tied to any one legal structure or narrow definition. If you have a way to earn money _and_ a way to deliver impact, the canvas is for you.

  Rather than getting lost in labels, we refer to all of these kinds of organizations combining business and impact models as simply **purpose-driven ventures**.



---

### **8. Why purpose-driven ventures matter**

Traditional businesses can't be relied on to solve the problems that the world faces, and increasingly they are the cause of many of these problems. 

At the same time, a whole new set of tools are arriving that make building purpose aligned organizations easier and more able to compete with traditional companies. Digital platforms, AI and other technologies are making it possible for purpose driven organizations to succeed in ways that were impossible in the past. 

There is a new playbook emerging for purpose driven ventures to harness technology, innovation, capital and networks in ways that have only been available to big traditional businesses. 

There’s already a rich history of purpose-driven organisations to learn from, and every day brings new examples of people using the tools of business to create positive change. 

The Social Lean Canvas exists to give these ventures a better shot at surviving and thriving in our shifting landscape.




---

### **9. About the Social Lean Canvas (origin & purpose)**

  

### **What is the Social Lean Canvas?**

  

But succeeding with this is complex and hard - most startups fail and the stats are even worse for purpose driven startups... where you have to figure out how to make the economics work (which is hard on it's own) AND figure out how to have a positive impact on the world at the same time. And it's not good enough to just rely on feel good vibes, you need to be able to prove that you are making a difference. 

Our goal with the Social Lean Canvas is to meaningfully increase the number of purpose-driven ventures that succeed – and, in our own small way, nudge the world in a better direction.

We created the Social Lean Canvas in 2013 and have been evolving it ever since as a **free, open-source tool**. It’s been used by **thousands of ventures**, accelerator and incubator programs, universities, NGOs and community organisations around the world.

  The canvas is designed to:

- **Demystify venture building** – by breaking it into a small set of core questions.
    
- It gives you a **simple framework and shared language** for your idea, so you can have better conversations with co-founders, partners, funders and stakeholders.
    
- And I gives you the confidence to move forward knowing that you can understand and prioritize the important steps that you need to take. 
    

It’s about creating coherence out of confusion and giving you a solid foundation to move from.

 In fact, once you have created your canvas, it will seem crazy to think you would have ever tried to build a venture without first mapping and making sense of it.  Even though that's what most people end up doing. 



---

### **10. How it works (the three models)**

  

The social lean canvas process builds out of startup best practice, first sketching the model that you think can work and then validating the riskiest pieces of it with real customers and stakeholders. And then based on this learning, evolving the model into something that can succeed.
  
The canvas starts by walking you through defining your purpose,
- the thing that you're here to do, 
- the thing that animates you. 
- The thing that keeps you focused and stops you becoming just another company 

It then breaks your venture down into three main models, 
- your customer model, 
- your impact model, 
- and your economic model.  
  
These three models need to fit together for your venture to succeed, but they can be worked on independently to make them easier to understand. 


Firstly you map your **customer model** – the part of your venture that creates value for customers: 

- **Customer segments** – who you serve
- **Jobs to be done** – what need of theirs are you serving
- **Unique value proposition** – why they would choose _you_.
- And **Solution** – what you actually deliver them

This can be:
- **Simple** – one clear product, one obvious customer.
- **More complex** – multiple customers (e.g. users vs payers vs partners).
- **Very complex** – multi-sided platforms or Web3 protocols where you might have customers, contributors, investors and community members all playing different roles in the model.
  
The canvas helps you get all of that out of your head and onto the page in a way you can actually work with.

Next is your **impact model** – your theory of change:

- How will what you do lead to real, provable change over time?
- What needs to happen in the short, medium and long term?
- And How will you know if it’s working?

This gets you beyond things that just _feel_ good.
It forces you to be honest about whether your activities connect to outcomes in a way that can be measured, tested and improved.


And then, Finally, you map your **economic model** – how money flows through your venture. This is:
- **Channels** – how people find you and how you deliver your solution to them.
- **Revenue** – where the money actually comes from and in what form.
- **Costs** – what it takes to deliver your product and your impact.
- And **Advantage** – why this is sustainable and defensible over time.

The goal is to see clearly whether your model can support **growth and sustainability**, not just survive in the short term, but thrive in a lasting way. 
  



#### **Using examples as you go**

You don’t have to start from a blank page.

As you work through the canvas, you can lean on the **venture example library** – collections of example canvases for different sectors, impact areas, geographies and founder types.

Seeing how ventures similar to yours express their customer, impact and economic models is a fast way to:
- understand how the canvas works, and
- spot patterns and options you might not have considered.

#### **Bringing it together**

These three models – **customer, impact and economic** – plus your purpose, all fit together in your Social Lean Canvas.

They give you an integrated view of your idea as a business model that can be both **financially sustainable** and **genuinely impactful** – a model you can then improve, test and, if it holds up, start to build from.

---

### **11. How long will this take?**

  How long will this take? 
  It depends where you’re starting from.

If your idea is fairly simple, and you’re already clear about how it works, you might be able to do your first Social Lean Canvas in a **couple of hours**.

If there’s a lot that still isn’t clear yet, it will take longer. This isn't a problem though – it’s the point. The canvas is designed to surface the questions you _haven’t_ properly answered yet, or didn't even know you needed to ask.

A few important things to keep in mind:
- **It’s not a race.**
    The goal isn’t to “finish your canvas as fast as possible”, it’s to think properly about the questions it raises.
- **You might be less clear than you think.**
    It’s common to start the canvas feeling confident, and then discover gaps and contradictions as you go. That can feel uncomfortable, but it’s a gift.
- **Better now than later.**
    It’s much better to learn that parts of your model don’t quite make sense while everything still lives on a single page, than after you’ve hired people, raised money or launched something you can’t easily change.
    
So give this the time it needs. Decisions that you make now as a result of getting really  clear about what you are doing, will pay you back many times over the life of your venture. 

You can do this in one sitting or in chunks, depending on what you need.

I’ll keep it real and walk you through each idea and each step on video, so you’re not staring at an empty template wondering what to do next.

### **12. Build & the pay-it-forward model (full version)**

  Once you’ve finished your Social Lean Canvas, you may have everything you need to move forward on your own.

But if you want more structure and support to **improve your model and design a strategy**, that’s what **Build** is for.

**Build** is a follow-on program for people who already have a completed Social Lean Canvas and want help to start making it real. In Build, there are 2 main pieces:
- **Improving your business model** – you stress-test your canvas, explore alternatives, and and make your business model stronger.
- **And then designing a strategy to take it forward** – you turn your model into an executable plan
    
- This lays out your road map for the immediate, short-term and medium-term timeframes.  

We keep the Social Lean Canvas program **free and open** by charging a **modest fee** for Build. But we ensure that if anyone can't afford this that this isn't a barrier. 
- If you can afford to pay for Build, **you pay**.
- If you can’t, let us know and we'll ensure there is space for you.

- People who can pay for Build help fund places for people who can’t.
- Together, they also help fund the work needed to keep the Social Lean Canvas free and open to everyone, and to keep improving these programs over time.


The goal is to make the whole system **financially sustainable**, while making sure that **no one misses out on this because of money**.

### **14. Program summary boxes**

  Claude - these summary boxes aren't part of the script but will go into creating a program slide for each program (which I'll create later). you can draw from these to get ideas for text to add into the content.

00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:07,679
testable business model that can succeed.

4
00:00:08,432 --> 00:00:12,092
I'll walk you through a set of simple
steps to map what you know, what

5
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:16,288
you suspect, and what you haven't
yet articulated into a coherent

00:00:16,288 --> 00:00:18,508
model that fits on a single page.

7
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,513
when you've completed your canvas,
you'll have a one page map of who you

8
00:00:22,513 --> 00:00:27,673
serve, how you create value, how you
make money, and how you create impact.

Organizations that care about both a
business model, a money system that

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:40,923
keeps you venture alive and an impact
model,  A clear logic for the change

12
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:41,998
you want to create in the world.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,410
This can include social enterprises,
community and indigenous ventures,

14
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:51,958
cooperatives, non-profits with
earned income, mission led startups,

15
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:54,268
solo ventures, and all the other.

16
00:00:54,268 --> 00:00:58,078
Yet to me imagined ways that we
can use a business model to deliver

17
00:00:58,078 --> 00:01:00,169
social or environmental impact.

18
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:04,513
If this is what you're working towards,
then the Social Lean Canvas is for you.

19
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:08,039
By the time you've finished
your social Lean Canvas, you'll

20
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,689
have made sense of your ideas.

21
00:01:09,948 --> 00:01:14,019
You'll have a clear one page map of
your venture and how it's going to work.

22
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:18,321
You'll have a shared language to talk
about your idea with co-founders,

23
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:22,562
funders, partners and supporters,
and you'll have a foundation upon

24
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:25,862
which you can build a clear strategy
to take your venture forward.

25
00:01:26,818 --> 00:01:29,937
The Social Link Canvas is
free and open to everyone.

26
00:01:30,635 --> 00:01:34,205
If after you've done your canvas,
you want more support to improve your

27
00:01:34,205 --> 00:01:38,330
model and design your strategy, There's
a follow on program called build.

28
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,470
We charge a modest fee for build to
help sustain this work, But we also

29
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,040
know that a modest fee for one person
could be a month's salary for another.

30
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:49,064
So if you want to join build,
but can't afford to pay for

31
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:50,234
it, we've got you covered.

32
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:52,184
No one misses out because of money.

33
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:55,457
People who pay for build
effectively pay it forward.

34
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:58,032
Helping fund places for
those who can't afford it.

35
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:01,485
and keeping the social lean canvas
accessible to anyone who needs it.

00:00:00,014 --> 00:00:03,704
There are lots of different ways that
using a business model to create social

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,624
or environmental impact can show up.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,380
You could call yourself a social
enterprise, a community or indigenous

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,137
enterprise, a cooperative, a
nonprofit with earned income.

5
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:16,541
A mission led startup or a
solo venture of some sort.

6
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,951
All of these have a mechanism for
money to flow through them, to

7
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:23,563
make them financially sustainable
and even profitable while having a

8
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:27,228
social or environmental mission or
can work in the social lean canvas.

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,430
We've deliberately designed the SLC
so that it isn't tied to any one

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,650
legal structure or narrow definition.

11
00:00:34,043 --> 00:00:37,553
If you have a way to earn money and
a way to deliver impact, the canvas

12
00:00:37,553 --> 00:00:41,853
is for you  Rather than getting
lost in labels, we refer to all

13
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:45,273
of these kinds of organizations
combining business and impact models

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,311
Simply as purpose-driven ventures.

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,091
Traditional businesses can't be relied
on to solve the problems that the world

16
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:56,261
faces, and increasingly, they're becoming
the cause of many of these problems.

17
00:00:57,158 --> 00:01:01,298
At the same time, a whole new set of
tools are arriving that make building

18
00:01:01,298 --> 00:01:06,098
purpose aligned organizations easier and
more able to compete with traditional

19
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:08,204
companies,  digital platforms.

20
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:11,843
AI and other technologies are making
it possible for purpose-driven

21
00:01:11,843 --> 00:01:15,563
organizations to succeed in ways
that were impossible in the past.

22
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,418
There's a new playbook emerging
for purpose-driven ventures to

23
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:23,868
harness technology, innovation,
capital, and networks in ways that

24
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:27,078
have only been available to big
traditional businesses in the past.

25
00:01:27,653 --> 00:01:30,833
And there's a rich history of
purpose-driven organizations to

26
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:35,158
learn from, and every day brings new
examples of people using the tools of

business to create positive change.

28
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:42,002
The Social Link Canvas exists to
give these ventures a better shot

29
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,162
at success in today's landscape.

30
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:48,158
But succeeding with this
is complex and difficult.

31
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:52,508
Most startups fail, And the stats are
even worse for purpose-driven startups

32
00:01:52,508 --> 00:01:56,048
where you have to figure out how to make
the economics work, which is hard on its

33
00:01:56,048 --> 00:02:00,547
own, and figure out how to have a positive
impact on the world at the same time.

34
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,937
And it's not good enough to
just rely on, feel good vibes.

35
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:06,734
You need to be able to prove
that you're making a difference.

36
00:02:07,684 --> 00:02:11,344
Our goal with the social Lean Canvas
is to meaningfully increase the

37
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:15,285
number of purpose driven ventures
that succeed in our own small way,

38
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:17,085
nudge the world in a better direction.

39
00:02:18,036 --> 00:02:21,876
We created the canvas in 2013 and
have been evolving it ever since

40
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:23,916
as a free and open source tool.

41
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:28,215
It's been used by thousands of ventures,
accelerators, and incubator programs,

42
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:32,207
universities, NGOs and community
organizations around the world.

43
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,083
The canvas is designed to demystify the
venture building process by breaking

44
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,543
it into a small set of core questions.

45
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:42,509
It gives you a simple framework
and a shared language for your

46
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:45,959
ideas so you can have better
conversations with co-founders,

47
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,969
partners, funders, and stakeholders.

48
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:51,222
and it gives you the confidence
to move forward knowing that you

49
00:02:51,222 --> 00:02:55,242
can understand and prioritize the
important steps that you need to take.

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,010
In fact, once you've created a venture
using the canvas, it will seem crazy to

51
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,851
think that you would've ever tried to
build a venture without first mapping it

52
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:07,679
and making sense of it, even though that's
what most people still end up doing.

53
00:03:08,657 --> 00:03:12,877
The social link canvas process builds
out of startup best practice  first,

54
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:16,507
sketching the model that you think
can work, and then validating the

55
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:20,222
riskiest pieces of this model with
real customers and stakeholders.

56
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:24,141
And then based on this learning,
evolving your model into

57
00:03:24,141 --> 00:03:25,086
something that can succeed.

58
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:29,641
The canvas starts by walking you through,
defining your purpose, the thing that

59
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:33,628
you're here to do, the thing that animates
you, The thing that keeps you focused and

60
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:35,689
stops you becoming just another company.

61
00:03:36,077 --> 00:03:38,957
It then breaks your venture
down into three main models,

62
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,870
your customer model, your impact
model, and your economic model.

63
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:47,029
These three models need to fit together
in order for your venture to succeed,

64
00:03:47,121 --> 00:03:51,081
but they can be worked on independently
to make them easier to understand.

65
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:55,541
Firstly, you map your customer model, the
part of your venture that creates value

66
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:59,889
for customers, your customer segments,
who you serve, their jobs to be done,

67
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:04,535
what need of theirs you're serving,
your unique value proposition, why they

68
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,200
would choose you and your solution,
what you actually deliver to them.

69
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:09,959
This can be simple.

70
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,786
One clear product, one obvious customer,
more complex, multiple customers.

71
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:17,449
For example, users, payers, and partners.

72
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:22,215
All very complex, multi-sided
platforms or Web3 protocols where you

73
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:26,328
might have customers, contributors,
investors and community members all

74
00:04:26,328 --> 00:04:27,978
playing different roles in the model.

75
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:32,192
The canvas helps you get all of that
out of your head and onto the page in

76
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:33,872
a way that you can actually work with.

77
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:37,599
Then follows your impact
model, your theory of change.

78
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:41,987
How will what you do lead to
real provable change over time?

79
00:04:42,302 --> 00:04:45,362
What needs to happen in the
short, medium, and long term?

80
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:47,595
And how will you know
if impact is happening?

81
00:04:47,974 --> 00:04:51,936
This gets you beyond things that just
feel good it forces you to be honest

82
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:55,446
about whether your activities connect
to outcomes in the world that can

83
00:04:55,446 --> 00:04:57,606
be measured, tested, and improved.

84
00:04:58,024 --> 00:05:01,020
And then finally, you map
your economic model, how money

85
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,280
flows through your venture.

86
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:05,881
This includes channels, how
people find you and how you

87
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:07,201
deliver your solution to them.

88
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:12,381
Revenue, where the money actually comes
from and in what form it comes, costs,

89
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:17,209
what it takes to deliver your product or
service, and your impact and advantage.

90
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:20,539
Why is this sustainable
and defensible over time?

91
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:23,963
The goal is to see clearly
whether your model can support

92
00:05:23,963 --> 00:05:25,733
growth and sustainability.

93
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:29,603
Not just survive in the short
term, but thrive in a lasting way.

94
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:32,574
You don't have to start from a blank page.

95
00:05:32,784 --> 00:05:35,754
As you work through your canvas,
you can lean on the venture example

96
00:05:35,754 --> 00:05:39,824
library  collections of example,
canvases for different sectors, impact

97
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:42,194
areas, geographies, and founder types.

98
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,820
Seeing how ventures similar to yours
express their customer impact and economic

99
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,940
models is the fastest way to understand
how the canvas works and spot patterns and

100
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,757
options that you might not have considered

101
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:55,521
How long will this take?

102
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:57,441
It depends on where you're starting from.

103
00:05:57,686 --> 00:06:01,700
If your idea is fairly simple and you're
already clear about how it works, You

104
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,370
might be able to do your first social
lean canvas in a couple of hours.

105
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:08,037
If there's a lot that still isn't
clear yet, it will take longer.

106
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,383
This isn't a problem though.

107
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:12,916
It's the point The canvas is
designed to surface The questions

108
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,476
you haven't properly answered yet.

109
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:17,786
or didn't even know that you
needed to ask  There's a few

110
00:06:17,786 --> 00:06:19,196
important things to keep in mind.

111
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:21,086
Firstly, it's not a race.

112
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,476
The goal isn't to finish your
canvas as fast as possible.

113
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:28,046
It's to think properly about
the questions that it raises.

114
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:30,222
You might be less clear than you think.

115
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:33,929
It's common to start the canvas
feeling confident, and then discover

116
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:35,939
gaps and contradictions as you go.

117
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:38,324
This can feel uncomfortable,
but it's a gift.

118
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:40,846
Better to do this now than later.

119
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:44,426
It's much better to learn the parts
of your model that don't quite make

120
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:48,429
sense when everything still lives on a
single page, rather than after you've

121
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:52,869
hired people, raise money or launch
something that you can't easily change.

122
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:57,738
So give this the time that it needs
decisions that you make now as a result

123
00:06:57,738 --> 00:07:01,560
of getting really clear about what you're
doing,  Will pay you back many times

124
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,180
over through the life of your venture.

125
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:08,104
I'll keep it real and walk you through
each idea and each step on video.

126
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:11,774
so you're not starting with an empty
template, wondering what to do next.

127
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:15,136
Once you've finished your social in
Canvas, you may have everything you

128
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:19,060
need to move forward on your own,  But
if you want more structure and support

129
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,808
to improve your model and design a
strategy,  That's what BUILD is for.

130
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:26,426
Build is a follow on program for
people who've already completed

131
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:30,302
the social in Canvas want help
to start making it real in build.

132
00:07:30,302 --> 00:07:31,592
There are two main pieces.

133
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:35,162
Improving your business model
where you stress test your canvas,

134
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:38,253
explore alternatives, and make
your business model stronger.

135
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:40,908
and then designing a
strategy to take it forward.

136
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,919
You turn your business model
into an executable plan.

137
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:47,422
this lays out your roadmap
for the immediate, short term

138
00:07:47,422 --> 00:07:48,652
and medium term timeframes.

139
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:54,142
We keep the Social Lean Canvas program
free and open by charging a modest fee for

140
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:58,336
build, but we ensure that if anyone can't
afford this, that the fee isn't a barrier.

141
00:07:58,605 --> 00:08:01,002
if you can afford to pay
for bill, then you do pay.

142
00:08:01,193 --> 00:08:05,463
If you can't, let us know and we'll
ensure that the space for you People

143
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:09,445
who can pay for build help fund
places for people who can't together.

144
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:13,375
This also helps fund the work needed
to keep the Social in Canvas program

145
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:17,575
free and open to everyone and to keep
improving these programs over time.

146
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:21,433
The goal is to make this whole system
financially sustainable while making

147
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:23,533
sure no one misses out because of money.

148
00:08:24,553 --> 00:08:28,453
If you're ready, let's start designing
your venture in the Social Link canvas.

149
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:31,376
First up, a quick look at how
to understand business models.
