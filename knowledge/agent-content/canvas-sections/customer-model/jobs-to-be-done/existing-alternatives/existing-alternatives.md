# Existing Alternatives

## Definition

**Existing Alternatives** show how your future customers are currently getting these jobs done. This section identifies current solutions or competitors addressing the same jobs that customers are trying to accomplish.

## Why Existing Alternatives Matter

### Evidence of Market Need

If your potential customers are already engaging with an existing alternative, it shows that the customer actually does want this job to be done in real life. This validates that there's genuine demand for solving this problem.

### Competitive Intelligence

Existing alternatives start to outline who your competitors might be, showing you who is already out there doing these jobs for your customer. This helps you understand the competitive landscape you're entering.

### Market Positioning

Understanding alternatives helps you identify gaps in current solutions and find opportunities for differentiation.

## Types of Existing Alternatives

### Direct Competitors
Solutions that address the same job in a similar way to what you're planning.

### Indirect Competitors
Solutions that address the same underlying job but through different approaches or business models.

### Workarounds and Makeshift Solutions
Improvised ways customers currently try to get the job done, often highlighting pain points in existing solutions.

### "Do Nothing" Alternative

You might find that you're competing against the existing alternative of just doing nothing. This is important to identify early because if your future customers are not currently trying to get these jobs done, it could mean they don't really care about getting them done after all.

## Implementation Tips

1. **Research each customer type separately** - Different customer types may have different existing alternatives
2. **Look beyond obvious competitors** - Include workarounds, DIY solutions, and substitute products
3. **Understand the "why"** - Why do customers choose current alternatives? What needs aren't being met?
