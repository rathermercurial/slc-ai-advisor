### The Startup Journey

Let's look at the journey from startup business model idea to successful venture, to understand how we move from guessing at a business model to designing one that works.

If you're new to startups, this may differ a lot from how you've thought about building organizations in the past. The modern startup approach is fundamentally different from the way that established businesses operate.

This section on the startup journey gives you a framework and a set of concepts that will help you make sense of what needs to happen, in what order and why.

This modern startup approach also arms you to respond to people recycling old-school  business advice about how to develop a venture. Or people from the nonprofit sector who might have old ideas about how purpose-driven ventures "should" be built.

Here's what we'll cover: 
	1. the fundamental difference between a startup and a business, 
	2. what the journey from one to the other looks like, 
	3. and what your venture will look like across this journey.

### Definition of a Startup

First, let's look at what it means to be a startup. And by "startup" I am meaning someone who innovating on a new idea that has some sort of economic engine, and in your case also an impact component. 

Knowing the difference between a startup and a business will shape your whole journey.

A startup isn't a small version of a big business. It's a fundamentally different thing.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Startup: temporary org to search | Business: permanent org to execute]`

As Steve Blank puts it, a startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable, scalable business model. A business is a permanent organization designed to execute on a repeatable, scalable business model.

In the startup phase, your job is to test the idea, learn, evolve it, and only once it's right, shift focus to execution.

`[MAIN PANEL: Search vs Execute comparison]`

This is the single most important point to grasp. Many startups jump straight to execution, get buried in operations, and never prove the model. They money and pour energy into trying to make a broken model work. And by the time they realize the model is wrong, they're too deeply committed to change direction. They either fail outright or fall way short of their potential.

This distinction is even more important for building purpose-driven ventures. Because you have the added complexity of an impact model to integrate, it's even more critical to test and learn, not just guess at the business model. There are too many things to get wrong.

### From Startup to Business

A startup searches for a repeatable, scalable business model by moving through cycles of validation and iteration.

You start with your initial business model idea. You map it into your Social Lean Canvas. Then you begin validating.

`[MAIN PANEL: Build-Measure-Learn cycle diagram]`

Validation means taking the assumptions inside your model - your untested guesses about how it's going to work - and testing them against reality to see if they hold up.

We take a scientific approach using a process called Build, Measure, and Learn. You build an experiment. You measure the results. You learn from what happened. Then you build the next experiment, informed by what you learned.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Build → Measure → Learn → Build]`

You start with the riskiest assumptions first - the ones that would kill the venture if wrong.

Then you fold what you learn back into the model. That's iteration, one version of your business model after the next until you have it right. Fewer guesses, more proven facts, a model that reflects reality and becomes increasingly likely to work.

This is exactly how an investor and funder would look for in a venture as well. The more it has been de-risked, the more likely it is to succeed and therefore the more likely someone is to want to fund it. 

### The Transition

Over time, you transition from mostly experimentation and learning to more and more execution as your confidence in the business model grows.

`[MAIN PANEL: Startup journey diagram showing transition]`

This is how a starting theory full of assumptions becomes a tight, validated business model. And how your organization shifts from a creative, flexible, networked startup to a structured, efficient, scalable business.

Your venture starting out on the left side of this diagram looks very different from when it gets to the right side. Left side - you're experimenting, learning, pivoting. Right side - you're executing, optimizing, scaling.

The journey from left to right is what we're mapping in this program. Business model design, improvement, validation, and strategy - these are the tools that move you through this transition.

### Founders First

In the startup phase, it's on you - the founders - to figure things out. You might bring others in later, but at the start, it's you.
 It's tempting to try to outsource some of the hardest bits. But don't fall into that trap.

During early validation and iteration, founders must hold the key roles in the organization and make the key decisions. Later, once the model is validated and you're starting to execute at scale, you can hire specialists. But don't hand your canvas to an "expert" to fill in the hard sections for you.

For example, in the startup phase, understanding your customers and crafting your unique value proposition is founders work. You can't hire a marketing person to do this for you. You need to learn from the customer firsthand and build the business model around them. Later you can hire marketing people to execute on your marketing.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Early stage: founder-led | Don't outsource model design]`

Get advice from people who know more than you. But you make the calls. Don't outsource crucial business model design.

This is what the Social Lean Canvas is desiged to help with, it keeps all the key pieces together in one coherent model so you can know what to do, when to do it, and can be the founder you need to be.
