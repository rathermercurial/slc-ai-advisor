# Assess Your Impact Model

Let's assess where your model might be weak. We'll look through four lenses.

### Fill in the Detail

If your impact model is still a rough sketch, flesh out enough of it so you can see and discuss how it works.

At this stage, you don't need every detail. But you need enough specificity to test the logic. You need to be able to explain: "We do these activities with these participants, which creates these short-term outcomes, which build to these medium-term outcomes, which over time generate these long-term outcomes and this ultimate impact."

You'll validate this later, but it has to look like it could work. It has to seem realistic on paper anyway.

### 1. Test the Logic

Does the causal chain actually hold up?

Start with the issue. Is this what you really think it is? Have you accurately diagnosed the problem, or are you addressing a symptom rather than a root cause?

Then the participants. Will they respond the way you expect them to? Are you making assumptions about their motivations, their capacity, their willingness to engage?

Then the activities. Will these actions actually generate the chain of outcomes you predict?

`[VISUAL TEXT: issue correct? | participants respond? | activities work?]`

Do research to test this logic. What have others learned? What does the academic literature say? What do experts in your field observe?

And be honest about what you don't know. It's better to identify weak logic now than to discover it after you've invested time and money.

### 2. Systems Thinking and Complexity Science Lens

Nothing happens in isolation. In the past, there have been many failures where people tried to solve a problem in isolation, only to have it backfire spectacularly.

You need to see the bigger picture. Use both systems thinking and complexity science perspectives.

`[MAIN PANEL: Simple system diagram showing interconnections]`

**Systems thinking asks:**

What is the larger system your impact operates within? Your issue doesn't exist in a vacuum. What surrounds it?

What different factors contribute to the problem? Multiple causes, multiple influences, multiple actors.

What activities will drive long-term impact on this issue? Both the activities your impact model will implement and those that others will do that share influence on the issue.

What unintended consequences could result from your activities? Systems are interconnected. Pull one lever and something predictable happens elsewhere.

**Complexity science adds:**

Systems are dynamic, non-linear, and adaptive. They don't behave in simple cause-and-effect ways.

Small interventions in the right places can create outsized change. These are called leverage points in the system.

Emergent properties means you can't predict outcomes just from looking at activities/inputs alone. The whole system creates results that are more than the sum of its parts.

Feedback loops show how outcomes reinforce or dampen activities over time. Virtuous cycles or vicious cycles.

`[VISUAL TEXT: interconnected | leverage points | emergent effects | feedback loops]`

Tony's Chocolonely in the example library demonstrates this well. They're not just working with individual farmers. They're intervening at multiple points in the cocoa system - digital tracking, premium pricing, transparency campaigns, industry advocacy, licensing their model to competitors. Each creates leverage. Together they're trying to drive systemic industry transformation.

### 3. Efficiency Lens

Is your impact model the most effective and efficient way to generate the outcomes you're trying to achieve?

Sometimes we get so enamored with our ideas that we miss better approaches.

A counter-intuitive example came out of a domestic violence program that spent years working with women victims. They invested in helping them build support groups. Learn to sew. Start small businesses. They tried many different interventions.

But in the end, they figured out that helping their husbands find jobs was the most efficient way to reduce the harm these women were suffering and create positive long-term outcomes.

`[VISUAL TEXT: years of victim services → husband employment = most efficient]`

The intervention that actually worked was upstream and adjacent to the obvious solution. Not what they expected. But more effective and more efficient. 

Use this efficiency lens. Ask yourself:

What's the root cause you're actually addressing?

Are there more efficient intervention points in the system?

Are your activities FEELING impactful but not actually driving longterm change?

This efficiency lens connects to your economic model as well: more efficient impact activities means better economics. If you can achieve the same outcomes with fewer activities, lower costs, simpler delivery - your business model becomes stronger.

Toast Ale shows this well. Rather than running education campaigns about food waste, they intervene at the recovery point - turning surplus bread into beer. Direct waste reduction, immediate emissions avoided, and they fund environmental charities with the profits. Check out their impact model in the example library.

### 4. Third Party Perspective

Get outside perspectives on all these assessment angles.

Talk with advisors and experts in your impact area. But critically, talk with people who have lived experience of the issues you're approaching.

`[VISUAL TEXT: advisors | experts | lived experience]`

People with lived experience have deep insights that might be non-obvious. Perspectives you can't get any other way. Their input is critical.

Also talk with organizations already doing similar work. They'll have learned things that can save you years of struggle.

Ask, where are the weaknesses in my model? What am I missing? What would you do differently?

It's a red flag if you are only getting input from people who think like you. You need perspectives that challenge your assumptions.

00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:01,824
Let's assess we, your model might be weak.

2
00:00:03,016 --> 00:00:07,179
If your impact model is still a rough
sketch, flesh out enough of it so that

3
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:09,279
you can see and discuss how it works.

4
00:00:09,515 --> 00:00:12,926
At this stage, you don't need
every detail,  But you need enough

5
00:00:12,926 --> 00:00:15,142
specificity to test the logic.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,785
You need to be able to explain.

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,409
We do these activities with these
participants, which creates these

8
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:25,860
short-term outcomes, which build to
these medium term outcomes, which

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,540
over time generate these long-term
outcomes and this ultimate impact.

10
00:00:31,244 --> 00:00:34,539
You'll validate this later, but
it has to look like it could work.

11
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:37,569
It has to seem realistic on paper anyway.

12
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,050
Does the causal chain actually hold up?

13
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:41,321
Start with the issue.

14
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:43,001
Is this what you really think it is?

15
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:46,984
Have you accurately diagnosed the
problem or are you addressing a

16
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:48,814
symptom rather than a root cause?

17
00:00:49,232 --> 00:00:52,872
Then the participants, will they
respond the way you expect them to?

18
00:00:53,212 --> 00:00:56,934
Are you making assumptions about
their motivations, their capacity,

19
00:00:56,994 --> 00:00:58,524
their willingness to engage?

20
00:00:58,946 --> 00:01:00,176
Then the activities.

21
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:03,986
Will these actions actually generate
the chain of outcomes you predict?

22
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,720
Do research to test this logic.

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,070
What have others learned?

24
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:10,299
What does the academic literature say?

25
00:01:10,594 --> 00:01:15,021
What do experts in your field observe
be honest about what you don't know?

26
00:01:15,282 --> 00:01:19,412
It's better to identify weak logic
now than to discover it after

27
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,522
you've invested time and money.

28
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:23,586
Nothing happens in isolation.

29
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:27,996
In the past, there've been many failures
where people have tried to solve a social

30
00:01:27,996 --> 00:01:32,976
or environmental problem in isolation,
only to have it backfire spectacularly.

31
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,183
You need to see the bigger picture.

32
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:39,201
Use both systems thinking and
complexity, science perspectives.

33
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:44,245
Systems thinking asks, what is the largest
system your impact operates within?

34
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:46,489
Your issue doesn't exist in a vacuum.

35
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:47,479
What surrounds it?

36
00:01:47,765 --> 00:01:50,225
What different factors
contribute to the problem?

37
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:53,555
Multiple causes, multiple
influences, multiple actors.

38
00:01:53,812 --> 00:01:56,722
What activities will drive
long-term impact on the issue?

39
00:01:57,294 --> 00:02:00,780
both the activities your impact
model will implement and those

40
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,160
that others will do that.

41
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,690
Share influence on the issue.

42
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,572
What unintended consequences
could result from your activities.

43
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:09,089
Systems are interconnected.

44
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:12,019
Pull one lever and something
predictable happens elsewhere.

45
00:02:12,851 --> 00:02:17,442
Complexity science  adds that systems
are dynamic, non-linear and adaptive.

46
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,838
They don't always behave in
simple cause and effect ways.

47
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:25,104
Small interventions in the right
place can create outsize change.

48
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:27,627
These are called leverage
points in the system.

49
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:31,246
Emergent properties means
you can't predict outcomes.

50
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:36,273
Just from looking at activities and inputs
alone,  the whole system creates results

51
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:38,223
that are more than the sum of its parts.

52
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:43,191
Feedback loops show how outcomes
reinforce or dampen activities over

53
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:46,003
time, virtuous cycles or vicious cycles.

54
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:50,801
Tony's Cholon in the example library
demonstrates this well, they're not

55
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:52,751
just working with individual farmers.

56
00:02:52,883 --> 00:02:56,393
They're intervening in multiple
points across the cocoa system.

57
00:02:56,781 --> 00:03:01,424
Digital tracking, premium pricing,
transparency campaigns, industry

58
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:06,040
advocacy, licensing, their model to
competitors, each creates leverage.

59
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:09,398
Together, they're trying to drive
systemic industry transformation.

60
00:03:10,748 --> 00:03:14,648
Is your impact model the most effective
and efficient way to generate the

61
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:15,943
outcomes you're trying to achieve?

62
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:20,887
Sometimes we get so enamored by our
ideas that we miss better approaches.

63
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:25,461
A counterintuitive example came out
of a domestic violence program that

64
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:27,621
spent years working with women victims.

65
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:30,894
They invested in helping them
build support groups to learn

66
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:33,024
to sow, start small businesses.

67
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:34,603
They tried many different interventions.

68
00:03:35,272 --> 00:03:39,266
But in the end, they figured out that
helping their husbands find jobs  was

69
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:42,924
the most efficient way to reduce the
harm that these women were suffering

70
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:45,105
and create positive long-term outcomes.

71
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:49,636
The intervention that actually worked
was upstream and adjacent of the obvious

72
00:03:49,636 --> 00:03:54,204
solution, not what they had expected,
but more effective and more efficient.

73
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:59,278
Use this efficiency lens to ask
yourself, what's the root cause

74
00:03:59,278 --> 00:04:00,658
that we're actually addressing?

75
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:03,793
Are there more efficient
intervention points in the system?

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,890
Are your activities feeling impactful but
not actually driving long-term change?

77
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:12,345
This efficiency lens connects
to your economic model as well.

78
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,860
More efficient impact activities
mean better economics.

79
00:04:16,353 --> 00:04:19,421
If you can achieve the same
outcome with fewer activities,

80
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:23,178
Lower cost, simpler delivery, your
business model becomes stronger.

81
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:29,253
Tota shows this well, rather than running
education campaigns about food waste, they

82
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:34,073
intervene at the recovery point, turning
surplus bread into beer, direct waste

83
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,353
reduction, immediate emissions avoided.

84
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,650
And they then fund environmental charities
with the profits, check out their

85
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,090
impact model in the example library.

86
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:46,782
Get outside perspectives on
all these assessment angles.

87
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:49,654
Talk with advisors and
experts in your impact area.

88
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:53,218
but critically talk with people
who have lived experience of

89
00:04:53,218 --> 00:04:54,418
the issues you are approaching.

90
00:04:54,824 --> 00:04:58,971
People with lived experience have deep
insights that might be non-obvious.

91
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:01,440
perspectives that you
can't get any other way.

92
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:02,989
Their input is critical.

93
00:05:03,782 --> 00:05:07,052
Also, talk with organizations
already doing similar work.

94
00:05:07,128 --> 00:05:10,218
They'll have learned things that
can save you years of struggle.

95
00:05:10,582 --> 00:05:12,652
Ask, where are the weaknesses in my model?

96
00:05:12,874 --> 00:05:13,771
What am I missing?

97
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:15,285
What would you do differently?

98
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:17,103
It's a red flag.

99
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:21,216
If you are only getting input from people
who think like you, you need perspectives

100
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:22,836
that challenge your assumptions.
