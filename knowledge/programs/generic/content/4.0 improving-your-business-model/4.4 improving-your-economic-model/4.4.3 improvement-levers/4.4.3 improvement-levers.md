# Understanding Leverage - The Multiplier

Now we need to talk about what makes an economic model truly powerful. This is about leverage.

### The Purpose-Driven Venture Trap

The issue with purpose-driven ventures is that often they evolve out of a nonprofit mindset or background.

The thinking is: "If only I can add an income stream to the impactful things that I'm doing, I can become financially sustainable."

This leads people to create weak models that are marginal at best and more often are outright failures.

Understanding the levers that produce efficiency and scale in a business model, and adding some of this leverage into your business model, is crucial to not falling into this trap.

### The iPhone Thought Experiment

Let's explore with a thought experiment.

Think about this question: Why can't the richest person in the world buy a better phone than I can?

Think about this. They can clearly buy better cars, better houses, better food than I can. But - assuming that I can buy the latest consumer iPhone - why, even if they spent ten million dollars of their own money developing it, can't they buy themselves a better phone?

Think about why there are no high-end phone companies. Apart from those companies that just stick diamonds to iPhones.

`[PAUSE - allow 3-4 seconds for reflection]`

The iPhone is the most financially successful product in the history of business. It's arguably the best phone ever made. And while it's expensive, it's affordable to a large portion of the world's population.

How is this possible? Unlike luxury cars, yachts, and houses...

### Business Model Leverage

It's possible because of a thing called business model leverage.

There are things that Apple does within its business model that have the effect of multiplying the value of the iPhone compared to what it costs for them to produce it. 

`[MAIN PANEL: Simple diagram showing leverage multiplier effect]`

Things like...

Their hugely expensive design effort being funded out of the sale of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of iPhones sold every year.

They own the App Store and have millions of developers working for free on products that make their product - the iPhone - more valuable.

They design and build the whole phone, from the chip to the handset to the software, allowing them to create efficiency and performance advantages throughout the whole platform.

They integrate the iPhone into a whole ecosystem of other products like the Apple Watch, iPad, iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV, and so on - that all make the phone more valuable. Imagine if someone had to buy all of these other businesses just to get their phone to work well.

`[VISUAL TEXT: design leverage | platform leverage | ecosystem leverage]`

You get the idea. All these different "levers" create a machine that massively increases the value of the phone while simultaneously lowering the cost of producing it.

And this dynamic is so powerful that even the richest person in the world can't get themselves a better phone, no matter how much they spent.

In fact, the only real way for them to make a phone as good as the iPhone would be to build their own version of Apple that itself could benefit from the business model leverage like Apple does.

### What Is Business Model Leverage?

Let's break down this business model leverage into its simplest form by asking the question: what is a business model actually doing?

The answer is: it's taking some resources and creating something out of them that is more valuable than these resources are on their own.

This increase in value is a form of leverage. A multiplication of the value of the resources through the magic of the business model.

Here's a simple example. If you take one hundred dollars worth of wood and spend four hours of your time - which you value at twenty-five dollars per hour - and make a table, you have consumed two hundred dollars worth of resources. That's wood and labor.

Then if you can sell the table for four hundred dollars, your "business model" has created two times leverage. It has converted two hundred dollars of resources into four hundred dollars of value for your customer.

This can also be expressed as a one hundred percent gross margin.

`[VISUAL TEXT: $200 resources → $400 value = 2× leverage (100% margin)]`

The greater the leverage, the more powerful, and more likely to succeed, your business model becomes.

### Types of Leverage

Let's look at the different ways that leverage works in a business model. You can then think about how you could use different forms of leverage to make your business model better.

### Patagonia - Leverage for Purpose-Driven Ventures

Patagonia is a good example of using business model leverage to achieve an impact goal while making the business model better.

In nineteen ninety-four, they wanted to switch to organic cotton for their clothing products. They became increasingly aware of the massive environmental costs of producing cotton using existing methods.

But when they looked into it, they found that their business model couldn't handle the extra costs of using organic cotton.

But they made it work using a couple of different forms of business model leverage.

First, they captured a small price premium from being organic. This is brand or perceptual leverage. 

And second, by developing new technology for processing organic cotton that massively reduced the cost of organic production. This is technology leverage.

This combination of being able to charge slightly more and at the same time reducing the cost of production enabled the business model to deliver the environmental benefits that they were going for and end up in a stronger, not weaker, position.

`[VISUAL TEXT: brand premium + tech innovation = impact + stronger economics]`


Use the business model leverage lens to understand what is strong about your current business model. And also where the opportunities to add leverage to the model might be.

Now we need to talk about what makes
an economic model truly powerful.

00:00:04,382 --> 00:00:05,342
This is about leverage.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,607
A really common issue with purpose-driven
ventures Is that often they evolve out

4
00:00:10,607 --> 00:00:12,857
of a nonprofit mindset or background.

5
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:17,222
The thinking is, if only I can add
an income stream to the impactful

6
00:00:17,222 --> 00:00:20,649
things that I'm already doing, I
can become financially sustainable.

7
00:00:20,998 --> 00:00:24,701
This leads people to create weak
models that are marginal at best and

8
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:26,891
more often than not outright failures.

00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,905
crucial to not falling into this trap.

Why can't the richest person in the
world by a better phone than I can?

15
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:48,289
Think about this carefully.

16
00:00:48,517 --> 00:00:52,177
They can clearly buy better
cars, better houses, better food,

17
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:57,450
but assuming that I can buy the latest
consumer iPhone, Even if they spent $10

18
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,666
million of their own money developing it,
can't they buy themselves a better phone?

19
00:01:02,343 --> 00:01:05,268
The iPhone is the most
financially successful product

20
00:01:05,268 --> 00:01:06,558
in the history of business.

00:01:06,636 --> 00:01:10,442
It's arguably the best phone ever

22
00:01:10,532 --> 00:01:13,382
it's affordable to a large

00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:15,214
How is this possible?

24
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:19,339
Unlike luxury cars, yachts,
and houses which are priced

25
00:01:19,339 --> 00:01:20,869
only for the ultra wealthy,

26
00:01:21,468 --> 00:01:24,785
It's possible because of a thing
called business model leverage.

27
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:29,381
There are things that Apple does within
its business model that have the effect

free on products that make their

They design and build the whole phone from

37
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:17,158
this integration with all these other
products make the iPhone more valuable.

38
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,827
Imagine if someone had to
recreate all of these businesses

39
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:22,267
just to make their phone work.

40
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,117
Well, You get the idea.

41
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:27,992
All these different levers create a
machine that massively increases the

42
00:02:27,992 --> 00:02:32,736
value of the iPhone while simultaneously
lowering the cost of its production.

43
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:36,586
And this dynamic is so powerful
that even the richest person in the

44
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:40,455
world can't get themselves a better
phone no matter how much they spend.

45
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:44,359
In fact, the only real way for them
to get a phone as good as the iPhone

46
00:02:44,473 --> 00:02:48,419
would be to build their own version of
Apple so that it could benefit from the

47
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,519
business model leverage that Apple does.

48
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:53,129
Let's break down this business model.

49
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:56,843
Leverage into its simplest form
by asking the question, what is

50
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,583
a business model actually doing?

51
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:02,708
The answer is it's taking some
resources and creating something

52
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:06,158
out of them that's more valuable
than these resources on their own.

53
00:03:06,374 --> 00:03:11,112
This increase in value is  leverage,
a multiplication of the value

54
00:03:11,112 --> 00:03:14,155
of the resources through the
magic of the business model.

55
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:15,943
Here's a simple example.

56
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:21,162
If you take $100 worth of wood and you
spend four hours of your time, which

57
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:26,653
you value at $25 per hour, and you make
a table, you have consumed $200 worth

58
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:28,663
of resources, the wood and the labor.

59
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:33,295
then if you can sell the table
for $400, your business model

60
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:35,332
has created two times leverage.

61
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:40,680
It's converted $200 of resources  into
$400 of value for your customer.

62
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:44,823
This can also be expressed
as 100% gross margins.

63
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:48,481
The greater the leverage, the more
powerful the business model and

64
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:50,161
the more likely it is to succeed.

65
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:54,284
Let's look at the different ways that
leverage works in a business model.

66
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:57,867
You can then think about how you
could use different forms of leverage

67
00:03:57,867 --> 00:03:59,337
to make your business model better.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,229
Patagonia, the outdoor clothing company
is a good example of using business model

2
00:00:04,229 --> 00:00:08,706
leverage to achieve an impact goal while
making the business model more powerful.

3
00:00:09,026 --> 00:00:13,768
In 1994, they wanted to switch to organic
cotton for their clothing products.

4
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:17,633
They became increasingly aware of
the massive environmental cost of

5
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:19,997
producing cotton using existing methods.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,704
but when they looked into it, they found
that their business model couldn't handle

7
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:26,044
the extra cost of using organic cotton.

8
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:30,663
But under turd, they figured out how to
make it work using a couple of different

9
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,493
forms of business model leverage.

10
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:36,896
Firstly, they captured a small
price premium for being organic.

11
00:00:37,132 --> 00:00:39,082
This is a type of brand leverage.

12
00:00:39,322 --> 00:00:43,880
The price premium wasn't enough to, in
itself solve the business model problem,

13
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:45,949
but it did contribute to solving it.

14
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:51,371
The second piece was developing new
technology for processing organic cotton.

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,420
This massively reduced the
cost of organic production.

16
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:57,052
this is the use of technology leverage.

17
00:00:57,512 --> 00:01:01,399
This combination of being able to
charge a slightly higher price and

18
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,035
reducing the cost of production,
enabled the business model to deliver

19
00:01:05,035 --> 00:01:08,995
the environmental benefits that they
were going for and end up in a stronger

20
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:10,645
position, not a weaker position.

21
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:15,393
Use the business model leverage
lens to understand what is strong

22
00:01:15,393 --> 00:01:19,018
about your current business model,
and also where the opportunities to

23
00:01:19,018 --> 00:01:20,878
add leverage to the model might be.
