**[MAIN PANEL: Completed Social Lean Canvas with all sections filled in]**

**Script (spoken):**

Great! You've filled in your Social Lean Canvas. That's an achievement worth acknowledging.

Most entrepreneurs never get, even to this level of clarity. They are just running on faith and instinct hoping that their original will just work if they build it. 

You've created a conceptual foundation—something you can test, improve, and evolve into a successful business model.


**[VISUAL TEXT: From scattered ideas → Coherent model]**

This is rare in the haphazard world of venture building. Well done!

**Tag line:** **Foundation complete.**

### What You Have Now

**[MAIN PANEL: Canvas sections highlighted]**

You have a clear sketch of your business model in one place. Your purpose, customer model, impact model, economic model and key metrics—all connected, all visible.

And you have a tool. You can take this canvas and talk it through with advisors, mentors, potential collaborators, other founders. Get their perspectives. Find out where your thinking might be off and discover gaps you hadn't seen.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Tool for conversation | Get perspectives | Find gaps]**

The canvas makes those conversations productive. Instead of vague ideas, you have something concrete to discuss and refine.

**Tag line:** **Ready for feedback.**

### You Built the Foundation

**[MAIN PANEL: Canvas as foundation, with space to build above it]**

You've built the foundation. The conceptual structure that everything else builds on.

Now you can build on it.

**Tag line:** **Foundation built.**
