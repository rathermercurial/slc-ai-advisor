**[MAIN PANEL: Key Metrics section on canvas]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
Key Metrics is where you capture a handful of numbers that show the current state of your venture. This section is different from the rest of your canvas.

Everything else on your canvas shows what you think will work—assumptions about your business model at scale. Key Metrics show what's actually happening right now. A snapshot of your progress.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Rest of canvas = Assumptions | Key Metrics = Reality]**

**Tag line:** **Track real progress.**

### What to Measure

**[MAIN PANEL: Three sections - Customer, Impact, Economic]**

Include at least one metric for each major part of your canvas —customer, impact, and economic models.

Choose metrics that show evidence of the key dynamics you're trying to prove. For your customer model, maybe it's new signups showing your value proposition resonates. For your impact model, maybe it's early outcomes you're measuring. For your economic model, maybe it's traction in your main acquisition channel. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Customer metric | Impact metric | Economic metric]**

These metrics will change as you progress. Early stage, you might track customer interviews completed or prototype tests run. Later, you'll be tracking things like revenue, retention and outcomes achieved. The important thing is that key metrics track your learning and emerging evidence that your business model works. Remember, at the start - progress is about learning and discovering, your early key metrics should track this. 

**Tag line:** **Match stage.**

### Keep It Simple

**[MAIN PANEL: Canvas with 3-5 key metrics filled in]**

Don't overthink this on your first pass. Pick three to five numbers that show where you are right now. You can always change them later.

The point is to have a clear view of progress. Not vanity metrics that look good but don't tell you anything useful. Real numbers that show progress. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: 3-5 metrics | Real progress | Not vanity]**

Document them in your canvas. Update them regularly. They become your dashboard for tracking whether you're moving in the right direction.
