## P2P FRAMING

**[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas with validation plans highlighted]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
You're about to work through the Core content on building your complete strategy model. This brings your validation plans together into an execution roadmap.

The Core Framework walks through the business model layer, organizational layer, and capital layer, showing how they interact across a 2/6/18 month timeline.

**[VISUAL TEXT: 3 layers | 2/6/18 timeline | Team example]**

Pay attention to how the layers work together as a system. After the Core content, we'll show you how to build this at P2P scale 

**Tag line:** **Three layers, one system.**

## P2P COMMENTARY

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Strategy at PPV Scale"]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
Now that you've worked through the Core Framework on building your strategy model, let's talk about what this looks like when you're bootstrapping solo or with a tiny team.

**Tag line:** **Adapt to your scale.**

---

### Strategy at P2P Scale

**[MAIN PANEL: Side-by-side comparison - Social enterprise/startup scale vs PPV scale]**

It's the same three layers. Same framework. Different scale.

The Core Framework applies to all purpose-driven ventures - including social enterprises and high-growth startups with teams and external funding. As a Purpose Pivot Venture you might be solo only have access to a few thousand dollars from savings, or no money at all. Those ventures might raise capital early. You might bootstrap indefinitely.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Team + funding vs Solo + bootstrap | Both valid approaches]**

The strategy approach is universal but execution adapts to your constraints.

As before your constraints help bring clarity. They force focus. They narrow your options to what actually works at your scale. They push you toward creative solutions you wouldn't have considered if you had unlimited resources.

**Tag line:** **Constraints drive creativity.**

---

### Timeline Flexibility

**[MAIN PANEL: Timeline comparison showing stretched PPV version]**

The Core Framework showed a 2/6/18 month timeline. That's ideal for early-stage ventures making this their full-time focus.

For a P2P venture, timelines might need stretch. If you're still employed and  working on this part-time. Your 2/6/18 might become 3/9/24 or even longer. On the other hand, if you are doing something comparatively simple, you might accelerate your timeline into something like 1/3/9. Feel into what suits your situation best.  


**[VISUAL TEXT: Still employed = validation time | No rush to revenue | Stronger proof]**

If you can take time for thorough validation because you're not burning through investor capital with a clock ticking. You can do more and deeper customer discovery and not commit yourself to a particular direction until you really know you are on the right track. 

If you're not sure what the right timeline is for your venture, stick with our 2/6/18 month starting point for now. 



**Tag line:** Pick the pace that works for you.**

### Organizational Layer Stays Lean

**[MAIN PANEL: Organizational layer comparison]**



For P2P ventures, the organizational layer often stays minimal much longer.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Solo longer | Contractors vs employees | Cloud tools]**

You might be the whole organization through early stage and into growth stage. When you do bring in help, it's often contractors for specific functions rather than employees. Your infrastructure often stays cloud-based and lean - Notion for docs, cloud hosting, SaaS tools instead of building custom systems.

**[VISUAL TEXT: LYT example | Solo + cloud tools | No formal structure needed]**

When might you bring in first help? Often when a specific bottleneck emerges that you can clearly delegate. DesignJoy might have brought in a contractor when design requests consistently exceeded what one person could deliver. Plausible Analytics will have eventually hired for customer support and infrastructure management.

But you don't need to plan for this in your 0-2 month timeline. Keep the organizational layer minimal until the business model layer demands more.



**Tag line:** **Stay lean longer.**

### Capital Layer: Bootstrap Paths

**[MAIN PANEL: Capital layer comparison]**


Many P2P ventures bootstrap through early stage - they make the finances work with savings and spending income. Some bootstrap to profitability and never raise external capital. Others may take small amounts of funding. Depending on the type of venture this could be in the form of a grant, maybe friends and family invest, they do a small angel investment round, take out a bank loan or something else. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Many bootstrap fully | Some raise small amounts | Both work]**

Your capital strategy layer might look like this:

**0-6 Months: Bootstrap**

Maybe $5K from savings. Covers hosting, tools, small experiments, venue rental for in-real-life experiments. Your burn rate is minimal because you're still employed. You're not paying yourself. Infrastructure costs are low.

No external capital needed yet. You're early. And that's fine - you're not trying to raise anything.

**[MAIN PANEL: Bootstrap runway visualization]**

**6-12 Month Inflection Point: First Revenue**

If your validation proves the model works, something changes. You have paying customers. You have proof that people will buy. Your unit economics are positive.

This might be your inflection point. Perhaps for raising capital or perhaps just for deciding whether to transition into working on it full-time


**[VISUAL TEXT: Proof point | Funding point | Decision point]**

**12-24 Months: Operating Revenue**

If you're growing, you might be funding that growth from revenue. Each month's income funds next month's expenses and small investments in growth. You're building a sustainable machine.

You might bring in a small amount of external capital at some point - maybe to accelerate something specific, maybe to smooth cash flow during a growth phase. 

But many P2P ventures often reach profitability without ever raising anything.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Revenue funds growth | Sustainable pace | Optional external capital]**

Your capital strategy reflects your goals. If you want to stay small and profitable, you might never raise anything. If you want to scale significantly, you might bring in capital once you have strong proof. Both are legitimate paths.

**Tag line:** **Revenue funds growth.**

### Your Turn: Create Your Strategy Model

**[MAIN PANEL: Blank strategy model template]**

You have everything you need to build your strategy model.

Follow the process from the Core Framework. Take your validation plans from sections from the validation sections for customer, impact and economic models and map them across your three layers and timeline.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Follow Core process | Adapt to your scale | Balance priorities]**

The key for ventures like yours is to weigh your priorities carefully. Balance what your venture needs against your personal circumstances. If you're still employed, your timeline can stretch. If you're bootstrapping, your organizational layer stays minimal longer.

Strike the balance that actually works for your situation. The framework is universal. Your execution is yours.
