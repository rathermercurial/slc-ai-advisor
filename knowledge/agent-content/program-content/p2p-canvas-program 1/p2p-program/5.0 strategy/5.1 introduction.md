## INTRODUCTION

p2p 5.1 introduction.webm

**[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas - full view]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
Now you've done a bunch of hard work. You've assessed your customer model, your impact model, and your economic model. You've identified weaknesses and strengthened them. You've moved beyond back-of-napkin thinking.

You now have one or more business models that are good enough to test.

So what's next?

Now you need strategy. You need to turn your business model into action.

**Tag line:** **From model to action.**

---

### Why Strategy Matters

**[MAIN PANEL: Multiple paths branching from current position]**

Strategy is what directs your time, effort, and money into the most important and valuable activities.

Missing on strategy is just as bad as missing on business model design. Both result in failure.

There are a million ways to burn time, money, and effort going in the wrong direction and getting nowhere. Threading a path for your venture through all the potential missteps - that's the job of good, strategy.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Strategy = directed action | Avoid missteps]**

**Tag line:** **Direction matters.**

## Strategy as a living process

It is also important for strategy to not be seen as a fixed thing. So often businesses end up executing on old strategies that haven't reflected the reality of the business for months or years.

It is doubly important when you are starting out, that your strategy be a flexible and evolving process. 

Because you will be constantly evolving your business model as you validate it, you will need to constantly evolve your strategy as well. 

Developing your strategy can't be about creating a giant document that everyone will blindly follow. It needs to be a flexible and evolving process that at any point in time captures your best path forward in your current reality. 

The strategy model is designed to be a living document that you constantly update as you learn and iterate your business model. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Strategy = constant evolution]**

### The Validation Journey

**[MAIN PANEL: Build-Measure-Learn cycle diagram]**

You'll recall from the module on business model design that the journey from untested business model idea to successful venture is one of validation and iteration. Taking the untested assumptions in your business model, testing them, and then evolving the business model as you learn.

This journey is what your strategy will map. It will make sure you're taking sensible next steps and not wasting your time and money on the wrong activities.

**Tag line:** **Test, learn, evolve.**

---

### What This Module Covers

**[MAIN PANEL: Three-step journey visual]**

This module takes you from untested business model to executable strategy. Three sections, three critical outputs.

**Section 5.2: Assessing Your Stage**

Firstly assessing your stage - The output of this is an understanding of where you are now across customer, impact, economic, and organizational dimensions.

You can't plan forward without knowing your starting point. This section gives you a clear assessment of your current stage so you can build a strategy that matches your reality.

**Section 5.3-5.6: Validation**

Secondly planning how to validate your business model. They output of this is validation plans for each of your customer, impact, and economic model models.

These plans specify exactly what assumptions you're testing, what experiments you'll run,  what success looks like, and what timeline and resources you need. 

**Section 5.7: Building Your Strategy Model**

And finally building your strategy model. The output of this is a complete multilayer strategy covering your business model development journey, organizational development, and capital strategy.

This integrates everything - your validation experiments, what organizational capacity you need and when and where capital enters to enable your plans. This is your clear but flexible roadmap from where you are now to validated, sustainable venture.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Know your stage | Plan validation | Build complete strategy]**

This is essential work. Without stage assessment, you're guessing where to start. Without validation plans, you're just hoping your assumptions are right. Without integrated strategy, you're reacting rather than executing deliberately.

With these outputs, you have a roadmap. Clear enough to execute. Flexible enough to adapt and evolve as you learn.

As with the previous modules, each section introduces Core Framework content that applies to all ventures, then reconnects with guidance specific to P2P ventures like yours - how to approach this work when you're solo or small team, building with limited resources.

**Tag line:** **Build your roadmap.**

### Let's Begin

**[MAIN PANEL: Transition to Stage Assessment section]**

Time to get systematic. We'll start by figuring out where you are right now on your venture journey.

Let's assess your stage.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,099
Now you've done a bunch of hard work.

2
00:00:02,309 --> 00:00:06,750
You've assessed your customer model, your
impact model, and your economic model.

3
00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:09,709
You've identified weaknesses
and strengthened them.

4
00:00:09,883 --> 00:00:12,553
You've moved beyond back
of the napkin thinking.

5
00:00:13,043 --> 00:00:16,883
You now have one or more business
models that are good enough to test.

6
00:00:17,348 --> 00:00:18,276
So what's next?

7
00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:19,969
Now you need strategy.

8
00:00:20,374 --> 00:00:23,104
You need to turn your
business model into action.

9
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:27,959
Strategy is what directs your time,
effort, and money into the most

10
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:30,149
important and valuable activities.

11
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:34,209
Missing on strategy is just as bad
as missing on business model design.

12
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:36,129
Both result in failure.

13
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,853
There are millions of ways to burn
time, money, and effort going in the

14
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:43,661
wrong direction and getting nowhere
threading a path for your venture

15
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:45,416
through all the potential missteps.

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,890
That's the job of strategy.

17
00:00:47,844 --> 00:00:51,474
It's also important for strategy
to not be seen as a fixed thing.

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,760
So often businesses end up executing
on old strategies that haven't

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,716
reflected the reality of the
business for months or even years.

20
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:03,353
It's doubly important when you're
starting out that your strategy be

21
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:05,333
a flexible and evolving process.

22
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:10,148
Because you'll be constantly evolving
your business model as you validate it.

23
00:01:10,298 --> 00:01:13,148
You'll need to constantly
evolve your strategy as well.

24
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:17,325
Developing your strategy can't be
about creating a giant document

25
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:19,259
that everyone will blindly follow.

26
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,563
It needs to be a flexible process that
at any point in time captures your best

27
00:01:24,563 --> 00:01:26,918
path forward in your current reality.

28
00:01:27,757 --> 00:01:31,297
The strategy model is designed
to be a living document that you

29
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:34,807
constantly update as you learn
and iterate your business model.

30
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:39,003
You'll recall from the module on
business model design that the

31
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:42,603
journey from untested business
model to successful venture is

32
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,853
one of validation and iteration.

33
00:01:45,432 --> 00:01:48,672
Taking the untested assumptions in
your business model, testing them,

34
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:50,472
and then evolving the business model.

35
00:01:50,502 --> 00:01:53,768
As you learn this journey is
what your strategy will map.

36
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:58,194
It will make sure that you take sensible
next steps and you're not wasting

37
00:01:58,194 --> 00:02:00,731
time and money on wrong activities.

38
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:06,168
This module takes you from untested
business model to executable strategy.

39
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:08,932
Three sections, three critical outputs.

40
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:10,596
Firstly, assessing your stage.

41
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:13,476
The output of this is an
understanding of where you're at

42
00:02:13,476 --> 00:02:18,311
now across customer impact, economic
and organizational dimensions.

43
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:22,037
You can't plan forward without
knowing your starting point.

44
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:25,547
This section gives you a clear
assessment of your current stage

45
00:02:25,697 --> 00:02:28,697
so that you can build a strategy
that matches your reality.

46
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:32,415
Secondly, planning how to
validate your business model.

47
00:02:32,926 --> 00:02:36,436
The output of this is validation
plans for each of your customer

48
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:38,416
impact and economic models.

49
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:42,343
These plans specify exactly what
assumptions you're testing, what

50
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:45,800
experiments you'll run, what
success looks like, and what

51
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,720
timeline and resources you need.

52
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,570
And finally, thirdly,
building your strategy model.

53
00:02:51,984 --> 00:02:55,569
The output of this is a complete
multi-layer strategy covering

54
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:58,419
your business model, development
journey, organizational

55
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,508
development, and capital strategy.

56
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:04,273
This integrates everything,
your validation experiments,

57
00:03:04,273 --> 00:03:08,035
what organizational capacity you
need, and when and where capital

58
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:09,310
enters to enable your plan.

59
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,278
This is your clear and flexible roadmap.

60
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:15,821
From where you are now to
validated sustainable venture,

61
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:17,547
this is essential work.

62
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:20,457
Without stage assessment, you're
guessing at where to start.

63
00:03:20,787 --> 00:03:24,807
Without validation plans, you're just
hoping that your assumptions are right.

64
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:29,427
Without integrated strategy, you
are reacting Rather than executing

65
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:34,019
deliberately with these outputs, you
have a roadmap clear enough to execute,

66
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:39,181
flexible enough to adapt and evolve
as you learn  as with the previous

67
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:43,786
modules, each section introduces core
framework content that applies to all

68
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:48,483
ventures, then reconnects with guidance
specific to P two P ventures like yours.

69
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,230
How to approach this work when you're
running solo or with a small team,

70
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:54,082
building with limited resources.

71
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,208
Time to get systematic.

72
00:03:56,298 --> 00:03:59,928
We'll start by figuring out where you
are right now on your venture journey.

73
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:01,065
Let's assess your stage.
