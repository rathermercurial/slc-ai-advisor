<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
You're about to work through the Core content on improving your customer model. This is critical work - getting your customer model right affects everything else.

The Core Framework walks through diagnostic checks, fundamentals, beachhead strategy, early adopters, and strategic levers for improvement. It shows you how to assess whether your market is big enough and how to strengthen weak areas.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Assess | Find weaknesses | Improve systematically]**

Pay attention to the beachhead concept. The Core Framework emphasizes narrow focus - finding that core segment you can win first. This matters even more when you're solo or small team. You can't serve broad markets. You need laser focus.

Also watch the TAM times ARPU math. Total addressable market times annual revenue per user. This tells you if your market is big enough. But the calculation works differently at P2P scale than for venture-backed startups.

After the Core content, we'll come back and talk about what customer model improvement looks like for P2P Ventures specifically.

## P2P COMMENTARY

p2p 4.2 improving-your-customer-model 2.webm

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Customer Model for PPVs"]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just walked you through how to assess and improve your customer model. Diagnostic checks, beachhead strategy, strategic levers, and the improvement process.

Now let's talk about what this means for ventures like yours.

**Tag line:** **P2P customer focus.**

---

### You Must Go Narrow

**[MAIN PANEL: Wide market vs. narrow beachhead visual]**

First, the beachhead principle is non-negotiable for PPVs.

You cannot serve broad markets solo. You don't have the resources. You don't have the channels. You don't have the time.

Remember 1,000 True Fans from when we filled in the Customer Model?  You need a minimum viable audience - a focused group who desperately wants what you're building.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Can't serve everyone | Must go narrow | Find desperate buyers]**

This is actually liberating. You're not trying to be everything to everyone. You're trying to be the perfect solution for a specific group of people who have a specific problem.

If your beachhead still feels too broad - like "small business owners" or "people interested in productivity" - narrow again. Keep narrowing until you can clearly see the faces of these customers. Until you know where they hang out online. Until you can describe their exact pain.

**Tag line:** **Narrow wins.**

---

### The Math Works at Your Scale

**[MAIN PANEL: TAM × ARPU calculation visual]**

The Core Framework showed you TAM times ARPU - total addressable market times annual revenue per user. This tells you if your market is big enough.

]The math work the same for small ventures but just at much smaller scale.

Let's say you need to replace a $100k salary. Add $20k for costs - tools, subscriptions, some contractor help. You need $120k in revenue to be sustainable.

**[VISUAL TEXT: $100k income | $20k costs | $120k revenue needed]**

How many customers does that take?

One thousand customers at $120 per year works. That's $10 per month subscriptions.

Or one hundred customers at $1,200 per year. That's $100 per month.

Or twenty customers at $6,000 per year. That's $500 per month retainers or a $6k annual fee.

**[VISUAL TEXT: 1,000 at $120 | 100 at $1,200 | 20 at $6,000]**

These are different models. To suit  dfferent segments. But all viable at P2P scale.

You don't need millions of customers. You don't need massive TAM. You need enough customers at the right ARPU to hit your sustainability number.

This changes what "big enough" means. A market that's too small for a VC-backed startup or a large social enterprise might be perfect for you.

**Tag line:** **Small can win.**

---

### Use AI to Accelerate Research

**[MAIN PANEL: Research workflow diagram]**

The Core Framework mentioned using AI tools for research and brainstorming. This matters even more for solo founders.

You can use AI to help estimate TAM for your beachhead segment. Research what competitors charge. Analyze customer segments and identify which have the strongest jobs to be done. Generate ideas for adjacent segments you might not have considered.

**[VISUAL TEXT: TAM estimation | Competitor research | Segment analysis | Idea generation]**

This replaces work that used to require hiring research firms or spending weeks manually gathering data. You can do in hours what used to take weeks and thousands of dollars.

AI is particularly good at pattern matching across markets and helping you see possibilities you might miss on your own. Use it throughout the improvement process - for research, for brainstorming strategic levers, for testing your logic.

**Tag line:** **AI accelerates work.**

---

### Example: Linking Your Thinking

**[MAIN PANEL: Linking Your Thinking canvas - Customer Model section]**

Let's look at an example. Let's use Linking Your Thinking and think about how they might have found their beachhead market. Now remember we are just playing with these examples. We don't know the detail of how they developed their early business model, but thinking through how it might have done it helps us understand the dynamics and decisionmaking involved. 

At Linking Your Thinking, Nick Milo could have gone broad with his market to: "Anyone interested in note-taking" or "people who want to be more productive" or "knowledge workers who need better systems."

Huge potential markets. Millions of people. But also impossible to serve well as a solo creator.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Could have: Anyone in note-taking | Millions of people | Impossible solo]**

Instead, he went narrow: Obsidian power users who want to level up their personal knowledge management.

Not ,all Personal Knowledge-Management Systems enthusiasts. Not all Obsidian users. Power users who are already deep into Obsidian and want to go further. People who've already chosen Obsidian over other tools and are committed to mastering it.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Actually: Obsidian power users | Want to level up | Committed + motivated]**

**[MAIN PANEL: Show beachhead segment characteristics]**

This beachhead works because:

They're identifiable. They hang out in Obsidian forums, the Obsidian subreddit, specific Discord servers. Nick knows exactly where to find them.

They have urgent pain. They're hitting the limits of basic Obsidian usage and getting frustrated. They want to unlock more potential but don't know how.

They're willing to pay. These are people who've already invested time and energy into learning Obsidian on their own initiative, they value learning and progress. They'll likely pay for a workshop that accelerates their progress.

The segment is big enough. Obsidian has hundreds of thousands of users. Power users might be five to ten percent of that. That's thousands of potential customers. More than enough.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Identifiable | Urgent pain | Will pay | Big enough]**

Let's do the math. If Nick needs $150k revenue to be sustainable - supporting himself and some costs - how many customers does he need?

His workshop is around $500. To hit $150k, he needs 300 customers per year. That's running four cohorts of 75 people. Or six cohorts of 50 people.

Completely achievable within that beachhead segment of Obsidian power users.

**[VISUAL TEXT: $500 workshop | $150k goal | 300 customers/year | 4-6 cohorts]**

**[MAIN PANEL: Return to full Customer Model canvas]**

And notice what happened. By going narrow, Nick can serve this segment incredibly well. The workshop is specifically designed for Obsidian. The examples use Obsidian. The community is all Obsidian users helping each other.

This creates better outcomes for customers, stronger word of mouth, and a sustainable business model at P2P scale.

That's the power of a focused beachhead.

**Tag line:** **Narrow enables excellence.**

---

### Your Turn

**[MAIN PANEL: Customer Model section on blank canvas]**

Now apply this to your own customer model.

Work through the Core Framework's improvement process. Gather input from advisors and use AI tools for research. Check the example library for similar ventures.

But as you do this, keep the P2P lens front and center:

Go narrow. Narrower than feels comfortable. Find that beachhead segment you can win with.

Do the TAM times ARPU math at your scale. Not venture scale. Your scale. What do you need to be sustainable?


**[VISUAL TEXT: Go narrow | Do your math | Use AI tools]**

Document your assumptions. Write down what you believe about your customer model. Who they are, what they need, what they'll pay. You'll test these assumptions in the Strategy section when you start validating.

You're about to walk through the core
content on improving your customer model.

2
00:00:04,015 --> 00:00:05,025
This is critical work.

3
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:08,621
Getting your customer model
right affects everything else.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,940
The core framework walks through
diagnostic checks, fundamentals,

5

beachhead strategy, early adopters,
and strategic levers for improvement.

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,760
It shows you how to assess whether
your market is big enough and

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,335
how to strengthen in weak areas.

8
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,433
Pay attention to the beachhead concept.

9
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:30,538
The core framework emphasizes
narrow focus, finding a core

10
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:32,428
segment that you can win first.

11
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:35,539
This matters even more when
you're solo or a small team.

12
00:00:35,762 --> 00:00:37,382
You can't serve broad markets.

13
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,822
You need laser focus.

14
00:00:39,599 --> 00:00:41,879
Also watch the TAM Times ARPU Math.

15
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:45,547
Total addressable Market
times annual revenue per user.

16
00:00:45,747 --> 00:00:49,236
This tells you if your market is
big enough, but the calculation

17
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:52,008
works differently for P two P
scale than for venture backed

18
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,928
startups and social enterprises.

19
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:57,970
After the core content, we'll come
back and talk about what customer

20
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,440
model improvements look like.

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,300
For P two P ventures specifically,

1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:04,151
The core framework just walked you through
how to assess and improve your customer

2
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:09,770
model, diagnostic checks, behead strategy,
strategic levers, the improvement process.

3
00:00:09,883 --> 00:00:12,313
Now let's talk about what this
means for ventures like yours.

4
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:16,575
First, the beachhead
principle is non-negotiable.

5
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:20,866
For P two P ventures, you
can't serve broad market solo.

6
00:00:21,052 --> 00:00:23,902
You don't have the resources,
you don't have the channels,

7
00:00:23,927 --> 00:00:25,155
you don't have the time.

8
00:00:25,362 --> 00:00:29,052
Remember 1000 true fans from when
you filled in the customer model.

9
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:33,401
You need a minimum viable audience,
a focus group who desperately

10
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:34,691
wants what you are building.

11
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:36,345
This is actually liberating.

12
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:39,927
You're not trying to be
everything to everyone.

13
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:44,046
You are trying to be the perfect
solution for a specific group of

14
00:00:44,046 --> 00:00:46,116
people who have a specific problem.

15
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:51,607
If your beachhead still feels too broad,
like small business owners or people

16
00:00:51,607 --> 00:00:57,337
interested in productivity, narrow,
again, keep narrowing until you clearly

17
00:00:57,337 --> 00:01:02,186
see the faces of these customers until
you know where they hang out online

18
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,226
until you can describe their exact pain.

19
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:09,018
The core framework showed
you TAM times arpu.

20
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:12,588
Total addressable market
times annual revenue per user.

21
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:15,337
This tells you if your
market's big enough.

22
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:20,917
The math works the same for small
ventures, but just at smaller scale.

23
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:27,687
Let's say you need to replace a $100,000
salary at $20,000 for costs, tools,

24
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:34,117
subscriptions, some contractor help you
need 120,000 in revenue to be sustainable.

25
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,234
How many customers does that take?

26
00:01:36,594 --> 00:01:40,974
1000 customers at $120 per year works.

27
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:44,064
That's $10 per monthly subscription.

28
00:01:44,592 --> 00:01:48,312
Or 100 customers at $1,200 per year.

29
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:54,933
That's $100 per monthly subscription,
or 20 customers at $6,000 per year.

30
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:59,799
That's a $500 per month
retainer or $6,000 annual fee.

31
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:03,789
These are different models to suit
different segments, but they're

32
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,859
all viable at P two P scale.

33
00:02:06,574 --> 00:02:09,964
If you don't need millions of
customers, you don't need massive tam.

34
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:14,666
You need enough customers at the right
ARPU to hit your sustainability number.

35
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:20,088
This changes what big enough means
a market that's too small for a

36
00:02:20,088 --> 00:02:24,108
VC-backed startup or a large social
enterprise might be perfect for you.

37
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:29,095
The core framework mentioned using AI
tools for research and brainstorming.

38
00:02:29,305 --> 00:02:31,615
This matters even more for solo founders.

39
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:35,956
You can use AI to help estimate
TAM for your beachhead segment.

40
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:38,116
Research what competitors charge.

41
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:42,884
Analyze customer segments and identify
which have the strongest jobs to be done.

42
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:47,624
Generate ideas for adjacent segments
that you might have not considered.

43
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:52,429
This replaces work that you to require
hiring research firms or spending

44
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:54,109
weeks manually gathering data.

45
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:58,072
You can do an hour is what used to
take weeks and thousands of dollars.

46
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:01,679
AI is particularly good at
pattern matching across markets

47
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:04,679
and helping you see possibilities
that you might miss on your own.

48
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:09,555
Use it  the improvement process for
research, for brainstorming strategic

49
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:11,760
levers, for testing your logic.

50
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:14,449
Let's look at an example.

51
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:18,681
Let's use linking your thinking
and understand how they might

52
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:20,091
have found their beachhead market.

53
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,791
Now remember, we're just
playing with these examples.

54
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:26,841
We don't know the details of how they
develop their early business model,

55
00:03:27,088 --> 00:03:31,309
but thinking through how it might
have happened helps us understand the

56
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:33,349
dynamics and decision making involved.

57
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,312
At linking your thinking.

58
00:03:35,312 --> 00:03:39,761
Nick Milow could have gone broad with
his market to anyone interested in note

59
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:44,910
taking, or people who want to be more
productive or knowledge workers who

60
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,551
need better systems, huge potential
markets, millions of people, but also

61
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:52,056
impossible to serve as a solo creator.

62
00:03:52,753 --> 00:03:56,908
Instead, he went Narrow obsidian
power users who want to level up

63
00:03:56,908 --> 00:03:58,663
their personal knowledge management.

64
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:02,524
Not all personal knowledge
management system enthusiast.

65
00:04:02,945 --> 00:04:07,895
Not all obsidian users, power
users who are already deeply into

66
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:09,773
obsidian and want to go further.

67
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:13,052
People who've already chosen
obsidian over other tools and

68
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:13,952
are committed to mastering it.

69
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:18,476
This beachhead works because
they're identifiable.

70
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,446
They hang out in obsidian
forums, the obsidian subreddit,

71
00:04:22,536 --> 00:04:24,306
specific discord servers.

72
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:26,526
Nick knows exactly where to find them.

73
00:04:27,026 --> 00:04:28,226
They have urgent pain.

74
00:04:28,556 --> 00:04:32,716
They're hitting the limits of basic
obsidian usage and getting frustrated.

75
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:35,671
They want to unlock more
potential but don't know how.

76
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,436
They're willing to pay.

77
00:04:37,815 --> 00:04:41,295
They're people who've already
invested time and energy into learning

78
00:04:41,295 --> 00:04:43,101
obsidian on their own initiative.

79
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:45,416
They value learning and progress.

80
00:04:45,476 --> 00:04:48,776
They're likely to pay for a workshop
that accelerates their progress.

81
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:51,052
This segment is big enough.

82
00:04:51,102 --> 00:04:53,742
Obsidian has hundreds
of thousands of users.

83
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:57,042
Power users might be five or 10% of those.

84
00:04:57,232 --> 00:05:01,072
That's thousands of potential customers,
more than enough to get started.

85
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:03,000
Let's do the maths.

86
00:05:03,223 --> 00:05:08,570
If Nick needs $150,000 revenue to be
sustainable, supporting himself and some

87
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,000
costs, how many customers does he need?

88
00:05:11,609 --> 00:05:16,104
His workshop is around
$500 to hit $150,000.

89
00:05:16,224 --> 00:05:18,474
He needs 300 customers per year.

90
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,810
That's running four cohorts of 75
people, or six cohorts of 50 people,

91
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:28,220
completely achievable with that beachhead
segment of obsidian power users.

92
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:34,844
notice what happened By going narrow, Nick
can serve this segment incredibly well.

93
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:38,144
The workshop is specifically
designed for obsidian.

94
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:40,267
The examples use obsidian.

95
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:43,577
The community is all obsidian,
users helping each other.

96
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:47,836
This creates better outcomes for
customers, stronger word of mouth,

97
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:50,032
and a sustainable business model.

98
00:05:50,122 --> 00:05:54,141
At P two P scale, that's the
power of a focus beachhead.

99
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,684
Now let's apply this to
your own customer model.

100
00:05:57,894 --> 00:06:01,854
Work through the core frameworks
improvement process, gather input from

101
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:04,674
advisors, and use AI tools for research.

102
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:07,641
Check the example libraries
for similar ventures.

103
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:11,395
But as you do this, keep the
P two P lens front and center.

104
00:06:11,665 --> 00:06:14,185
Go narrow, narrower
than feels comfortable.

105
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:17,265
Find that beachhead segment
that you can win with.

106
00:06:17,786 --> 00:06:21,482
Do the TAM times ARPU math
at your scale, not venture.

107
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:22,659
Scale your scale.

108
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,303
What do you need to be sustainable?

109
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:27,751
Document your assumptions.

110
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:31,741
Write down what you believe about
your customer model, who they are,

111
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:33,691
what they need, what they'll pay.

112
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:36,890
You'll test these assumptions
in the strategy section

113
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:38,019
when you start validating.
