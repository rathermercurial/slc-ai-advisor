Improve.Leverage.Types

Types of leverage

1. Figuring out how to add more leverage, is the most powerful way to fundamentally improve your business model. Let’s walk through the 8 types of leverage, and while we do keep in mind how you could design more leverage into your business model using one or more of these types of leverage.

1
00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:04,857
Figuring out how to add more leverage is
the most powerful way to fundamentally

2
00:00:04,857 --> 00:00:06,177
improve your business model.

3
00:00:06,627 --> 00:00:10,797
Let's walk through the eight different
types of leverage, and while we do

4
00:00:10,797 --> 00:00:15,927
keep in mind how you could design more
leverage into your business model using

5
00:00:15,927 --> 00:00:17,967
one or more of these types of leverage.


    

GoodBM.Improve.Leverage.2Types.Labour 598786787

Improve.Leverage.Types.1

2. Firstly Labour leverage - this is one of the oldest forms of business model leverage - labour leverage is when you add more labour to a business process, and at the end of the day you make more profit from the extra products you produce that the extra labour cost you. 
    

3. For example, you are trying to grow potatoes and your realise that if you get people to help you, you can grow 10 times as many potatoes with only 5 times more labour. Once you have paid for the labour you have more potatoes than you would have had if you had just worked on it yourself

1
00:00:00,038 --> 00:00:01,598
Firstly, labor leverage.

2
00:00:01,748 --> 00:00:04,568
This is one of the oldest forms
of business model leverage.

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:09,158
Labor leverage is when you add more
labor to a business process, and at

4
00:00:09,158 --> 00:00:12,488
the end of the day, you make more
profit from the extra products you

5
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:14,798
produce than the extra labor cost.

6
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:15,008
You.

7
00:00:15,608 --> 00:00:19,538
For example, if you're trying to
grow potatoes and you realize that

8
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:24,368
if you get people to help you, you
can grow 10 times as many potatoes

9
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:26,528
with only five times as much labor.

10
00:00:27,188 --> 00:00:31,568
Once you've paid for the extra labor,
you have more potatoes than you would've

11
00:00:31,568 --> 00:00:33,968
had had you just worked on it yourself.



GoodBM.Improve.Leverage.2Types.Technology 598787988

Improve.Leverage.Types.2

3. Technology leverage - this is almost as old as labour leverage, but it runs all the way up to today with quantum computers and immutable ledgers. 
    
4. Technology leverage is when you use tools to multiply your ability to produce value.
    

5. You are growing potatoes and instead of paying others to help, you invest in a shovel that speeds up your work and you can produce 10 times more potatoes for the same amount of work. That’s technology leverage

1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:04,357
This is almost as old as labor leverage,
but like labor leverage, it runs

2
00:00:04,357 --> 00:00:08,527
all the way up to today with quantum
computers and immutable ledgers.

3
00:00:08,887 --> 00:00:13,682
Technology leverage is when you use tools
to multiply your ability to produce value.

4
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:19,057
You are growing potatoes and instead
of paying others to help you invest

5
00:00:19,057 --> 00:00:23,017
in a shovel, that speeds up your work
and you can produce 10 times more

6
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:25,387
potatoes for the same amount of work.

7
00:00:25,717 --> 00:00:27,307
That's technology leverage.



GoodBM.Improve.Leverage.2Types.Capital 598759864

Improve.Leverage.Types.3

5. Capital Leverage - Capital leverage was the driver of much of 20th century development. It is when other people’s stored labour (Capital) is used to fund the development of new value creating activities.
    

6.  If you save up enough of the proceeds of your potato farm you can start loaning your capital out to other promising farmers to help them pay for labour and technology that will grow their production and your earn a return on the capital

1
00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:01,195
Capital leverage.

2
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:05,515
Capital leverage was the driver of
much of 20th century development.

3
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:11,245
It is when other people stored Labor
Capital is used to fund the development

4
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:13,435
of new value creating activities.

5
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:17,635
If you save up enough of the
proceeds of your potato farm, you

6
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:21,835
can start loaning your capital out
to other promising farmers to help

7
00:00:21,835 --> 00:00:23,965
them pay for labor and technology.

8
00:00:24,395 --> 00:00:28,715
That will grow their production and it
will earn you a return on your capital.


    

GoodBM.Improve.Leverage.2Types.Product 598787543 

Improve.Leverage.Types.4

6. Product leverage - This is when you pull together a process of value creation into a coherent product that can then be sold. The leverage in products is in their ability to scale. Where providing a service might be limited to how many clients you can serve, a product can potentially be scaled to an unlimited number of people. 
    

7. For example if you are a sports coach with a unique and highly successful method. You can keep trying to advance your career by getting better and better coaching jobs, or you could turn your system into a product that other coaches could buy and use themselves to become more successful.
    
1
00:00:00,087 --> 00:00:01,167
Product leverage.

2
00:00:01,467 --> 00:00:05,457
This is when you pull together a
process of value creation into a

3
00:00:05,457 --> 00:00:07,947
coherent product that can then be sold.

4
00:00:08,577 --> 00:00:12,087
The leverage in products is
in their ability to scale.

5
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:17,007
We are providing a service might be
limited to how many clients you can serve.

6
00:00:17,577 --> 00:00:21,267
A product can potentially be scaled
to an unlimited number of people.

7
00:00:22,497 --> 00:00:28,407
For example, if you're a sports coach with
a unique and highly successful method, you

8
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:32,457
can keep trying to advance your career by
getting better and better coaching jobs.

9
00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:36,657
Or you could turn your system into
a product that other coaches could

10
00:00:36,657 --> 00:00:40,527
buy and then they could use it
themselves to become more successful.




GoodBM.Improve.Leverage.2Types.Media 598786893

Improve.Leverage.Types.5

7. Media leverage - similar to product leverage but focused on taking information and turning it into a media asset that scale across media channels. Especially now with digital media platforms, media assets can scale at zero marginal cost. Meaning that you pay once to produce the e-book, podcast, online course, song, video etc, and then every time it is consumed it earns you money but it doesn’t cost you any more money. This idea of scaling at zero marginal cost is very high leverage if you can make it work for you. 


1
00:00:00,106 --> 00:00:04,396
Media leverage is similar to product
leverage, but focuses on taking

2
00:00:04,396 --> 00:00:09,556
information and turning it into media
assets that scale across media channels.

3
00:00:10,216 --> 00:00:14,716
Especially now with digital media
platforms, media assets can scale

4
00:00:14,716 --> 00:00:17,536
at zero marginal cost, meaning that.

5
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:23,156
You pay once to produce that ebook,
podcast, online course song, video,

6
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:28,256
et cetera, and then every time it's
consumed, it earns you money, but

7
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:29,906
it doesn't cost you any more money.

8
00:00:30,716 --> 00:00:34,976
This idea of scaling at zero
marginal cost is very high leverage

9
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:36,446
if you can make it work for you.



GoodBM.Improve.Leverage.2Types.Perceptual 598787297

Improve.Leverage.Types.6

8. Perceptual Leverage -  perceptual leverage is the way you change the way people think, feel or experience a thing by altering the presentation, story or context around the thing. This can be amazingly powerful as you don’t have to change any of the physical atoms, you can increase the value of a thing just by changing how people perceive it. 
    

9. This can show up as traditional branding - where you spend money to build a story about a product to change how people feel about it.
    
10. It can also utilise powerful tools like behavioural science and game theory to redesign how people perceive and relate to products and services
    
11. This can be especially powerful for social enterprises to utilise. 
    
1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,210
Perceptual leverage.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:06,970
Perceptual leverage is the way you change
the way people think, feel, or experience

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:12,370
a thing by altering the presentation
story or context around the thing.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,910
This can be amazingly powerful
as you don't have to change

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,590
any of the physical atoms.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,270
You can increase the value of a thing
just by changing how people perceive it.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,310
This can show up as traditional
branding where you spend money to

8
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,720
build a story around a product and
change how people feel about it.

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:37,120
But it can also utilize powerful
tools like behavioral science and game

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,310
theory to redesign how people perceive
and relate to products and services.

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,510
This can be especially powerful
for social enterprises to utilize.




GoodBM.Improve.Leverage.2Types.Network 598787119

Improve.Leverage.Types.7

9. Network Leverage - Network leverage takes advantage of the non-linear nature of network connectivity. Metcalf’s Law defines how the value of a network increases as the square of the number of nodes in the network. Which means if a network goes from 10 to 100 members the value of the network goes from 100 to 10,000. Network Leverage has driven the rise of tech mega companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft etc. But it shows up in lots of smaller examples.
    

10. Network Leverage includes things like Network Effects (of which there are 13 distinct types) as well as things like Viral effects utilised by the likes of facebook to drive user growth.
    
11. There are many different ways to utilise network leverage though, and many that are relevant to social enterprises 


    
1
00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:01,307
Network Leverage.

2
00:00:01,517 --> 00:00:06,557
Network leverage takes advantage of the
nonlinear nature of network connectivity.

3
00:00:07,157 --> 00:00:12,347
Metcalf's law defines how the value of
a network increases as the square of the

4
00:00:12,347 --> 00:00:18,047
number of nodes in the network, which
means if a network goes from 10 members

5
00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:22,907
to a hundred members, the value of the
network goes from a hundred to 10,000.

6
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:28,712
In this way, network leverage has
driven the rise of the big tech mega

7
00:00:28,712 --> 00:00:33,062
companies like Google, Facebook,
apple, Microsoft, et cetera.

8
00:00:33,512 --> 00:00:36,362
But it shows up in lots of
smaller examples as well.

9
00:00:36,962 --> 00:00:40,802
Network leverage includes things like
network effects, of which there are

10
00:00:40,802 --> 00:00:45,542
13 distinct types, as well as things
like viral effects utilized by the

11
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:47,342
likes of Facebook to drive user growth.

12
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:52,637
There are many different ways to utilize
network leverage though, and many of

13
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:54,857
these are relevant to social enterprise.

GoodBM.Improve.Leverage.2Types.Strategic 598787671

Improve.Leverage.Types.8

10. Strategic Leverage - This final type of leverage is not strictly a type of business model leverage. The first 7 types of leverage we have looked at are a kind of power that operates within a business model and that drive that business model to grow and succeed. Strategic Leverage on the other hand, is an external type of leverage. It consists of ways of influencing a market or competition externally. 
    

11. For example - large players exert strategic by having control or influence over markets through things like monopoly practices
    
12. What we call Dirty strategic leverage, can include force, blackmail and bribery of officials etc
    
13. Less dirty forms might be lobbying and other kinds of political influence 
    
14. Companies like Facebook and Google use their ownership of giant platforms, multiple interconnected businesses and huger data advantages to exert and profit from strategic leverage 
    
15. It’s important to note though, that Strategic leverage can be used for both good and bad. Often social enterprises can use strategic leverage to push for systemic change. Sometimes change needs to be forced and creating strategic leverage can be a useful strategic move.


1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:01,329
Strategic leverage.

2
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:04,839
This final type of leverage
is not strictly a type of

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,069
business model leverage.

4
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:10,479
The first seven types of leverage
we looked at are kind of power that

5
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:15,459
operates within the business model and
that drive a business model to grow and.

6
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:21,189
Strategic leverage, on the other
hand, is an external type of leverage.

7
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:26,229
It consists of ways of influencing
a market or competition externally.

8
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:31,839
For example, large players exert
strategic leverage by having control

9
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,679
or influence over markets through
things like monopoly practices.

10
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:40,434
What we call dirty strategic
leverage can include force,

11
00:00:40,464 --> 00:00:42,774
blackmail, and bribery of officials.

12
00:00:43,104 --> 00:00:48,054
Less dirty forms might be lobbying or
other kinds of political influence.

13
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:53,514
Companies like Facebook and Google use
their ownership of giant platforms,

14
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:59,604
multiple interconnected businesses,
and huge data advantages to exert and

15
00:00:59,604 --> 00:01:02,124
profit from type of strategic leverage.

16
00:01:02,904 --> 00:01:06,114
It's important to note though
that strategic leverage can

17
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:07,854
be used for both good and bad.

18
00:01:08,604 --> 00:01:13,404
Often social enterprises can use strategic
leverage to push for systemic change.

19
00:01:13,944 --> 00:01:18,624
Sometimes change needs to be forced,
and creating strategic leverage

20
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:20,754
can be a useful strategic move.
