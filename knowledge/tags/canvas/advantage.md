The Advantage section of your economic model is about understanding what is powerful about how your business model works. What is the leverage that is generated in your business model? That when you reach the scale you're going for, will make your business model successful. If there is no powerful advantage, you will not be able to make your revenue greater than your costs long term. That is, you won't be financially sustainable.

All businesses need to have one or more fundamental dynamics that make them work. It is possible to have a product that people want and will pay for channels to reach customers through and the ability to deliver this at scale, but to never be able to make the economics work. This is because there's not enough leverage in the business model. No matter how hard you try, you just can't make your revenue greater than your costs.

You need an advantage in the form of some type of leverage to make the difference. This advantage could take many different forms. It could be owning a crucial piece of intellectual property that others don't have access to. It could be having access to a key resource at a discount or for free, benefiting from powerful network effects, having valuable brand associations like a celebrity endorsement, access to cheap or free capital. For example, if there's an impact investment that's available on better terms than your more commercial competitors can get, or some other form of leverage.

### Advantage: Innovate

The advantage section of your canvas is often where you can innovate on your business model. It's the place where you can brainstorm how your business model can be improved by finding an advantage that you can build on. This is especially important if after sketching your financial model, you find that the numbers don't really stack up.
