Now your economic model, how you achieve financial sustainability while delivering your impact model

`[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas - highlight Economic Model section]`

You can have the best customer and impact models in the world. But without economics that work, you don't have a sustainable venture.

### The Two Jobs

As we discussed earlier, your economic model has two main jobs in these early stages.

First: Can your business model produce positive unit economics?

Second: Can it grow to the size you need it to be?

In order to take your next steps in the canvas process, you need your economic model to be good enough to take forward. Like with your customer and impact models, this doesn't have to be complete or perfect. After this step, you're going to start validating your business model, and it will evolve from here anyway.

But at this stage, it does need to go beyond your back-of-napkin starting point and be able to demonstrate enough potential to justify putting time and effort into it.

### Quick Diagnostic Check

Before we dive in, ask yourself these questions about your economic model:

Can you clearly show how you will produce positive unit economics?

Do you know your breakeven point and the path to get there?

Do you understand what needs to be validated in your channels to reach enough customers?

Is there leverage in your model, or is it purely linear?

If you're hesitating on any of these, your economic model probably needs some work. Red flags include negative margins, unrealistic scale assumptions, and no clear understanding of costs.
