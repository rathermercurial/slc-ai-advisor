## **Origin story (3–5 lines)**

- Founded by **Marcin Jakubowski** in **2003**, headquartered at **Factor e Farm** in Maysville, Missouri. OSE’s core idea is the **Global Village Construction Set (GVCS)**—open plans for ~50 industrial machines needed to build a small, modern “village.” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Ecology)) 
    
- The GVCS concept was publicly coined in **2008**; Jakubowski’s 2011 TED talk put the project on the map. ([GVCS wiki](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/Global_Village_Construction_Set)) 
    
- Over time OSE expanded from prototypes (e.g., open-source tractor, CEB press) into **open hardware construction** and training programs. ([GVCS wiki](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/Global_Village_Construction_Set)) 
    

  

## **What it is**

- A nonprofit R&D + training network publishing **open hardware** and **open business models** so people can build real-world machines and housing. Flagship: the **Seed Eco-Home**, a ~1,300 sq ft model designed for rapid “swarm builds.” ([Seed Eco-Home builds](https://www.opensourceecology.org/seed-eco-home-builds/)) 
    

  

## **How it funds the work (solo-friendly angles)**

- **Workshops & programs** (hands-on builds, microfactory courses). ([Workshops & Programs](https://www.opensourceecology.org/workshops-and-programs/); [Microfactory site](https://microfactory.opensourceecology.org/)) 
    
- **Seed Eco-Home sales** used to fund continued GVCS development; **technical blueprints and business models are open source** so participants can spin up ventures. ([Future Builder Crash Course](https://www.opensourceecology.org/future-builder-crash-course-is-here/)) 
    
- Ongoing **product evolution**: **Seed Eco-Home 4** product release and multi-year immersion programs announced in 2024. ([SEH4 release](https://www.opensourceecology.org/2024-product-release-of-seed-eco-home-4/)) 
    

  

## **Scale / team (directional)**

- Small nonprofit led by the founder with rotating fellows/participants; in **May 2025** OSE launched a **four-year, $100k on-site Fellowship** (ages 18–24). ([OSE Fellowship](https://www.opensourceecology.org/introducing-the-ose-fellowship/)) 
    

  

## **Recent traction signals (2024–2025)**

- **Apr 2025:** Seed Eco-Home “Rosebud” model completed; target **$60k materials** bill; OSHWA certification planned. ([Seed Eco-Home builds](https://www.opensourceecology.org/seed-eco-home-builds/)) 
    
- **Jul 2025:** “Future Builder Crash Course” launch; **first Seed Eco-Home listed for sale** as proof of the enterprise model; funds earmarked for GVCS completion. ([Crash Course post](https://www.opensourceecology.org/future-builder-crash-course-is-here/)) 
    
- Active **workshops/microfactory** event listings. ([Microfactory site](https://microfactory.opensourceecology.org/)) 
    

  

## **Why it’s relevant to SLC (solo-preneur with purpose)**

- **Purpose-first, replicable ventures:** OSE publishes **open designs + open business models** that an individual or tiny crew can copy—e.g., **build and sell Seed Eco-Homes**, or operate **microfactory** services (fabrication, repairs). ([Crash Course post](https://www.opensourceecology.org/future-builder-crash-course-is-here/)) 
    
- **Modern tooling without big teams:** Participants leverage **swarm builds**, standard BOMs, and shared documentation to deliver complex outcomes with minimal headcount. ([SEH4 release](https://www.opensourceecology.org/2024-product-release-of-seed-eco-home-4/))
