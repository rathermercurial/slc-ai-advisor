## Fill In Your Canvas

**[MAIN PANEL: Empty Social Lean Canvas outline]**

**Script (spoken):**
**Clap**
Now you've got the fundamentals. Now it's time to fill in your canvas.

This module walks you through each section step by step - Purpose, Customer Model, Impact Model, Economic Model, and Key Metrics.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Purpose | Customer | Impact | Economic | Metrics]**

This is your first pass. The goal? Get your thinking down. Not perfect - just down.

You'll refine everything later in Module 2, so don't get stuck here trying to nail every detail. Move through at a good pace. Speed over perfection.

**[VISUAL TEXT: First pass | Get it down | Refine later]**

**Tag line:** **First draft, not final.**

### Three Integrated Models

**[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas with three models highlighted]**

You're building three models that work together as a system.

Your Customer Model - how you create and deliver value to customers.

**[MAIN PANEL: Highlight Customer Model section]**

Your Impact Model - how your activities deliver meaningful change in the world.

**[MAIN PANEL: Highlight Impact Model section]**

Your Economic Model - how you achieve financial sustainability and success.

**[MAIN PANEL: Highlight Economic Model section]**

**[VISUAL TEXT: Customer Model | Impact Model | Economic Model]**

For each section, you'll see Core Canvas content that covers the universal frameworks and principles. Then we'll reconnect with P2P-specific guidance for your context - focusing on solo or small team ventures, building with limited resources.

Work through each section in order. These instructions will guide you.

**Tag line:** **Three models, one system.**

---

### Still Deciding What to Build?

**[MAIN PANEL: Multiple canvas outlines side by side]**

If you're still figuring out what your Purpose Pivot Venture will actually be, you can fill in more than one canvas to cover two or three ideas. Then you can map them out side by side and decide which to take forward.

Different ideas will show different strengths across the canvas sections. Seeing them mapped separate helps you decide which to focus on.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Multiple ideas? | Multiple canvases | Compare side by side]**

**Tag line:** **Map your options.**

### Use the Example Library

**[MAIN PANEL: Example library visual]**

As you work, use the Venture Example Libraries to see what other ventures did when building their business models. See their choices, their approaches and their trade-offs.

The examples show you what's possible and help you think through your own decisions.

**[VISUAL TEXT: See examples | Learn from others | Guide your choices]**

**Tag line:** **Learn from examples.**

---

### Working on Your Canvas

**[MAIN PANEL: Canvas collaboration options visual]**

You can work on your canvas on paper. Some people print out a large copy, put it on the wall, and use sticky notes. Very tactile and ever-present.

If you're collaborating digitally, the using a shared whiteboarding tool is a good approach.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Paper + sticky notes | Digital whiteboard | Download templates]**

**[MAIN PANEL: Download button visual]**

Download the canvas templates and models to work on, from the resources section.

**Tag line:** **Choose your tools.**

---

### Keep It Simple

**[MAIN PANEL: Simple canvas vs. detailed canvas comparison]**

For your first pass, keep it simple and high-level. Structure first. Detail later.

If you're early stage, use back-of-napkin numbers. What's your best starting guess? Start simple, add complexity as you learn.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Structure first | Detail later | Best guess is fine]**

**Tag line:** **Start simple.**

---

### Ready to Begin

**[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas - highlighting Purpose section]**

Start with Purpose - why your venture exists. Then move through each section.

Let's go.

**Tag line:** **Time to build.**

It's time to fill in
your social lean canvas.

3
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:10,687
This module walks you through each
section, step by step, purpose,

4
00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:15,577
customer model, impact model,
economic model, and key metrics.

5
00:00:15,953 --> 00:00:18,803
This is your first pass
through the canvas, the goal.

6
00:00:19,294 --> 00:00:20,575
Get your thinking down.

00:00:20,755 --> 00:00:22,975
Not perfect, just get it down.

8
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:27,012
You'll refine everything later on
in module two, so don't get stuck

9
00:00:27,012 --> 00:00:31,062
here trying to nail every detail,
move through at a good pace.

10
00:00:31,122 --> 00:00:32,562
Speed over perfection.

11
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:37,128
you're building three models
that work together as a system.

12
00:00:37,783 --> 00:00:43,368
Your customer model, how you create and
deliver value to customers, your impact

13
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:48,408
model, how your activities deliver
meaningful change in the world, and

14
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:52,833
your economic model, how you achieve

15
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:57,387
For each section you'll see core
canvas content that covers the

16
00:00:57,387 --> 00:00:59,397
universal frameworks and principles.

17
00:00:59,787 --> 00:01:04,377
Then we will reconnect with P two P
specific guidance for your context,

18
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:09,477
focusing on solo and small team ventures,
building with limited resources.

19
00:01:09,788 --> 00:01:11,918
Work through each section in order.

20
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:13,568
These instructions will guide you.

21
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:19,115
If you're still figuring out what your
purpose pivot venture will actually be,

22
00:01:19,385 --> 00:01:24,113
you can fill in more than one canvas at
this stage to cover two or three ideas.

23
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:28,551
Then you can map them out side by
side and decide which to take forward.

24
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:33,277
Different ideas will show different
strengths across the canvas sections.

25
00:01:33,517 --> 00:01:37,597
Seeing them mapped out separately
helps you decide which to focus on

26
00:01:38,637 --> 00:01:42,837
As you work, use the venture example
libraries to see what other ventures

27
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:44,817
did when building their business models.

28
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:48,327
See their choices, their
approaches, and their trade offs.

29
00:01:48,496 --> 00:01:52,681
The examples show you what's possible and
help you think through your own decisions.

30
00:01:54,017 --> 00:01:56,267
You can work on your canvas on paper.

31
00:01:56,327 --> 00:02:00,467
Some people print out a large copy and
put it on the wall and use sticky notes.

32
00:02:00,737 --> 00:02:05,027
It's very tactile and ever present
if you're collaborating digitally

33
00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:08,297
though, using a shared whiteboarding
tool is a good approach too.

34
00:02:09,273 --> 00:02:14,043
Download the canvas templates and models
to work on from the resources section.

35
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,979
For your first pass through the
canvas, keep it simple and high

36
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:21,889
level structure first, details later.

37
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:25,504
If you are early stage, use
back of the napkin numbers.

38
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:27,664
What's your best starting guess?

39
00:02:27,724 --> 00:02:28,804
Start simple.

40
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:30,574
Add complexity as you learned.

41
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,760
Start with purpose, why
your venture exists.

42
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,980
Then move through each section in order.

43
00:02:37,664 --> 00:02:38,174
Let's go.
