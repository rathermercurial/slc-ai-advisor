### Costs

For costs, this might include the costs involved with making your product or service, marketing costs, distribution costs, and the cost of delivering your impact activities. This will also include any other major ongoing costs that your business model will have to cover. Keep all of this simple and high level to start with. This will give you the shape of your financial model and allow you to assess its viability as well as what might need to change about it. Over time, you will add in more detail as you move forward with your enterprise and test the revenue and cost assumptions in this model.
