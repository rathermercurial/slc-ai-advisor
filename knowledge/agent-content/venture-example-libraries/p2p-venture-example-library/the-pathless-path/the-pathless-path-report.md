# Research Report: The Pathless Path

## 1. Description

The Pathless Path was founded by Paul Millerd after he quit his prestigious strategy consulting job at McKinsey & Company in 2017. Born in Connecticut, Paul followed the traditional "default path" through top-tier consulting firms and MIT business school before experiencing a health crisis that shifted his values. The enterprise is a content and education business that helps people reimagine their relationship with work and life. Its purpose is to challenge the conventional "default path" of success and inspire people to find their own unique "pathless path" toward fulfillment. The business model works through book sales (65k+ copies sold), online training courses (StrategyU), coaching services, a newsletter with 25k+ subscribers, and speaking engagements, operating as a fully location-independent venture.

## 2. Purpose

**Purpose Detailed Analysis**: The Pathless Path addresses the fundamental problem of people feeling trapped in conventional career paths that prioritize external metrics of success over personal fulfillment and meaningful work. Paul Millerd identified that many high-achievers follow what he calls the "default path" - graduate, work a long career, retire - without questioning whether it aligns with their values or desires. The organization exists to help people escape this invisible script and discover work that makes them feel fully alive, challenging the assumption that prestigious careers automatically lead to happiness.

**Purpose Synopsis (fewer than 25 words)**: Help people escape conventional career paths and discover work that creates fulfillment and meaning rather than just external success.
