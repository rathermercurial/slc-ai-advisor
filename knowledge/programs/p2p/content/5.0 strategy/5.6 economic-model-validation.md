**[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas - Economic Model section highlighted]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
You're about to work through the Core content on economic model validation. This covers what customer validation already proved about your economics, validating channels, revenue, costs, and advantage, and using integrated MVPs to test multiple assumptions together.

When you come back,  we'll talk about economic model validation at P2P scale.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Channels | Revenue | Costs | Advantage | Integrated testing]**

**Tag line:** **Prove the economics work.**

## P2P COMMENTARY

p2p 5.6 economic-model-validation 2.webm

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Economic Validation for PPVs"]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just walked you through economic model validation. Now let's talk about what this looks like at PPV scale.

**Tag line:** **P2P economic validation.**

---

### Economics at Small Scale

**[MAIN PANEL: Small scale economics diagram]**

First, remember your economics work at a different scale than funded startups and social enterprises.

Your breakeven is lower. Your fixed costs are minimal. You don't need massive volume to be sustainable - you need the right margins with modest volume.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Lower breakeven | Minimal fixed costs | Margins over volume]**

This changes what you're validating. You're not proving you can get to 100,000 customers. You might be proving that you can get to 1,000 at the right price with manageable costs.

Validate at YOUR scale, not someone else's.

**Tag line:** **Validate your scale.**

---

### Keep It Lightweight - But Test Key Advantage Dynamics

**[MAIN PANEL: Simple validation focus diagram]**

Don't over-complicate your economic validation with complex financial modeling before you have proof.

You don't need detailed three-year projections. You need to prove unit economics are positive and channels can deliver enough customers for you to grow at acceptable cost.

The detailed financial modeling comes later when you're in execution mode.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Unit economics positive | Channels work | Keep simple]**


**Test your advantage assumptions** -  If you're counting on higher-than-average word-of-mouth customer acquisition, you need to prove this will actually happen. Test whether your early customers refer others at the rate you're assuming.

If you're planning to charge a premium based on your social mission or purpose alignment, validate that customers will actually pay it. Don't assume mission justifies higher pricing - prove it.

If your leverage depends on specific dynamics - like community creating content, or network effects kicking in at certain scale, or platform efficiencies - test whether these dynamics actually work the way you think.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Word-of-mouth rate? | Mission premium? | Key dynamics work?]**

Your advantage assumptions are critical to your economic model. If they don't work, your economics might not work. Validate them early.

**Tag line:** **Test advantage assumptions.**

---

### AI Tools for Economic Validation

**[MAIN PANEL: AI economic modeling workflow]**

AI tools can help you validate economic assumptions that used to require financial analysts or consultants.

**Unit economics modeling:** Build financial models that test different scenarios - pricing, volume, costs. See where breakeven happens under different assumptions.

**Channel cost analysis:** Research typical CAC for your channels and business model type. Understand what's realistic before you spend money testing.

**Pricing research:** Analyze competitor pricing, willingness-to-pay data, and market benchmarks to validate your pricing assumptions.

**Cohort analysis:** Model retention and lifetime value scenarios based on different churn assumptions.

This can give you valuable insights and baselines for what to test in your experiments. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Model scenarios | Research CAC | Analyze pricing | Project LTV]**

For example, Plausible Analytics could have used AI to model unit economics at different scales. If they charge $9/month and host costs are $2/customer/month, what happens at 100 customers versus 1,000 versus 10,000? When do they hit breakeven? What do their margins look like as they scale?

They could use AI to research pricing of comparable services and then test those price bands with an online signup flow.

They could research typical CAC for developer tools sold through content marketing and Product Hunt. They could then validate this through some online market testing that drives traffic to the same online signup flow.

This analysis that would have cost thousands from consultants, they can do themselves with AI assistance.

**Tag line:** **AI models economics.**

---

### Integrated MVP Validation

**[MAIN PANEL: Integrated MVP diagram showing customer + economic + impact validation]**

The Core Framework talked about MVPs that validate multiple assumptions simultaneously.

One well-designed experiment can validate multiple customer, economic, and impact assumptions together.

**[VISUAL TEXT: One experiment | Multiple models validated | Efficient]**

Let's look at examples from the library:

**Tag line:** **Integrated efficiency.**

---

#### Example: DesignJoy Economic Validation

**[MAIN PANEL: DesignJoy MVP validation]**

DesignJoy could have validated their economic model through a simple MVP: Offer unlimited design subscription to five clients for one month at their target price point.

This would validate customer assumptions - do agencies actually want unlimited design? Will they use it enough to justify the subscription?

It validates economic assumptions - can one designer handle five unlimited clients profitably? What are the actual time costs per client? Does the subscription price cover costs with healthy margin? What's the realistic client capacity?

**[VISUAL TEXT: 5 clients | 1 month | Target price | Multiple validations]**

One MVP, multiple models validated efficiently. After one month, they know if the model works or needs adjustment.

**Tag line:** **One test, many answers.**

---

#### Example: Linking Your Thinking Economic Model Validation

**[MAIN PANEL: LYT workshop MVP]**

Linking Your Thinking could have validated their economics through a pilot workshop. Run one cohort of 30 people at the target price point.

Customer validation - does the workshop format work? Is the content valuable? Will people complete it?

Economic validation - does the pricing work? Can one person run a cohort of 30 profitably? What are the actual time costs? What does customer acquisition cost through content marketing? Do customers refer new customers?

Impact validation - are people actually improving their thinking systems? Are they getting the outcomes they came for?

**[VISUAL TEXT: 30 people | Target price | Can one person run it? | All models tested]**

One pilot cohort validates the full model. If it works at 30, they can scale to multiple cohorts. If it doesn't, they learn what to fix before investing more.

**Tag line:** **Pilot proves model.**

---

#### Example: Buy Me Once Economic Validation

**[MAIN PANEL: Buy Me Once marketplace MVP]**

Buy Me Once could validate their marketplace economics with a curated pilot. List 50 products in one category - say, kitchen items. Drive traffic through content about buying quality over quantity.

Customer validation - will people buy through the platform? Does the curation add value? Do customers trust the recommendations?

Economic validation - what's conversion rate from visitor to buyer? What affiliate commission or margin can they earn per transaction? What's CAC through content marketing? Can organic content drive enough traffic?

Impact validation - are customers choosing durable products they wouldn't have found otherwise? Is this actually reducing waste?

**[VISUAL TEXT: 50 products | 1 category | Content traffic | Full model tested]**

One focused pilot validates whether the marketplace model works before building out hundreds of product listings.

**Tag line:** **Curated pilot proves concept.**

---

### Your Turn

**[MAIN PANEL: Economic Model section on canvas]**

Now apply this to your economic validation.

Use AI tools to support this, and look for integrated MVP opportunities. Can one experiment validate your customer, economic, and impact models together? This could be the most efficient path forward.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Your scale | Test advantage | AI tools | Integrated MVPs]**

**Create your validation plan document** as outlined in the Core content section. What will prove your economic model works? What metrics will show positive unit economics? What CAC is acceptable? What conversion rates do you need? List your experiments to prove these metrics with clear success criteria.

And remember: customer validation already proved a lot. You know people will pay. You know channels exist. Now you're proving the economics work at the scale you need with the dynamics you're counting on.

00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:03,902
You're about to work through the core
content on economic model validation.

2
00:00:04,162 --> 00:00:07,430
This covers what customer model
validation already proved about

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,930
your economics, validating channels,
revenue costs, and advantage,

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,228
and using integrated MVPs to test
multiple assumptions together.

5
00:00:16,973 --> 00:00:19,183
When you come back, we'll
talk about economic model

6
00:00:19,183 --> 00:00:21,193
validation at P two P scale.





p2p 5.6 economic-model-validation 2.webm.02.mp4.webm

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,779
The core framework just walked you
through economic model validation.

2
00:00:04,031 --> 00:00:07,631
Now, let's talk about what this
looks like at P two P scale.

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:08,639
again.

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,479
First, remember, your economics
work at a different scale than a

5
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,699
funded startup or social enterprise.

6
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:16,747
Your break even is lower.

7
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:18,397
Your fixed costs are minimal.

8
00:00:18,696 --> 00:00:21,456
You don't need massive
volume to be sustainable.

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,427
You need the right margins
With modest volume,  this

10
00:00:25,427 --> 00:00:26,866
changes what you're validating.

11
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:30,505
You're not proving that you can get
to a hundred thousand customers.

12
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:34,156
You might be proving that you can
get to a thousand at the right

13
00:00:34,156 --> 00:00:36,166
price with manageable costs.

14
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:39,410
Validate at your scale,
not someone else's.

15
00:00:40,427 --> 00:00:44,477
Don't overcomplicate your economic
validation with complex financial

16
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:49,099
modeling before you have proof You don't
need detailed three year projections.

17
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:52,819
You just need to prove that unit
economics are positive and that your

18
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:57,289
channels can deliver enough customers
for you to grow at an acceptable cost.

19
00:00:57,746 --> 00:01:01,790
The detailed financial modeling comes
later when you're in execution mode.

20
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:05,171
Test your advantage assumptions.

21
00:01:05,354 --> 00:01:09,820
If you're counting on higher than average
word of mouth customer acquisition, you

22
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:11,780
need to prove this will actually happen.

23
00:01:12,243 --> 00:01:16,203
Test whether your early customers refer
others at the rate you're assuming.

24
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:20,666
If you're planning to charge a
premium based on your social mission

25
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:24,539
or purpose alignment, validate the
customers will actually pay it.

26
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:28,502
Don't assume that mission
alignment justifies higher pricing.

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,070
Prove it.

28
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:34,252
If your leverage depends on specific
dynamics like community creating

29
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:38,854
content or network effects kicking
in at a certain scale or platform

30
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:43,086
efficiencies, test whether these dynamics
will actually work the way you think.

31
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:46,795
Your advantage assumptions are
critical to your economic model.

32
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:50,361
If they don't work, your
economics might not work.

33
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:51,336
Validate them early.

34
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:51,696
Okay.

35
00:01:52,937 --> 00:01:56,537
AI tools help you validate economic
assumptions that used to require

36
00:01:56,537 --> 00:01:58,637
financial analysts or consultants.

37
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:02,548
For unit economics modeling,
build financial models that

38
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:04,168
test different scenarios.

39
00:02:04,318 --> 00:02:06,268
Pricing volume costs.

40
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:09,399
See where break even happens
under different assumptions.

41
00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:14,056
You can do channel cost analysis,
research, typical customer

42
00:02:14,056 --> 00:02:17,024
acquisition costs for your
channel and business model type.

43
00:02:17,644 --> 00:02:19,234
Understand what's realistic.

44
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:23,857
Before you spend money on testing,
You can do pricing research, analyze

45
00:02:23,857 --> 00:02:27,877
competitor pricing, willingness to
pay data and market benchmarks to

46
00:02:27,877 --> 00:02:32,668
validate your pricing assumptions,
and you can do cohort analysis, model

47
00:02:32,668 --> 00:02:37,138
retention, and lifetime value scenarios
based on different churn assumptions.

48
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,906
This can give you valuable
insights and baselines for what

49
00:02:40,906 --> 00:02:42,256
to test in your experiment.

50
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,030
This kind of AI research can give
you valuable insights and baselines

51
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,950
for what to test in your experiments.

52
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:51,746
Let's look at an example.

53
00:02:52,073 --> 00:02:57,443
Plausible analytics could have used AI to
model unit economics at different scales.

54
00:02:57,686 --> 00:03:01,951
If they charge $9 a month and
hosting costs are $2 per customer

55
00:03:01,951 --> 00:03:06,686
per month, what happens at a hundred
customers versus a thousand customers?

56
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:07,949
10,000 customers.

57
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,846
When do they hit break even?

58
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,430
What do their margins
look like as they scale?

59
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,619
How do they change?

60
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:19,374
They could use AI to research pricing of
comparable services and then test those

61
00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:21,744
price bands with an online signup flow.

62
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:25,323
They could research typical
customer acquisition costs for

63
00:03:25,323 --> 00:03:28,713
developer tools through content
marketing and product hunt.

64
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:32,670
They could then validate this through
some online market testing that drives

65
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,040
traffic to the same online signup flow.

66
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:39,521
This analysis that would've cost
thousands using consultants, they

67
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:41,801
can do themselves with AI assistance.

68
00:03:43,063 --> 00:03:46,436
The core framework talked about
MVPs that validate multiple

69
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:47,876
assumptions simultaneously.

70
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:53,032
One well-designed experiment can validate
multiple customer economic and impact

71
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,922
model assumptions at the same time.

72
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,826
Let's play with an
example from the library.

73
00:03:58,246 --> 00:04:02,206
Designy could have validated their
economic model through a simple

74
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:06,677
MVP Offer an unlimited design
subscription for five clients for

75
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:08,619
one month at the target price point.

76
00:04:09,202 --> 00:04:10,984
This would validate customer assumptions.

77
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,134
Do agencies actually
want unlimited design?

78
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:17,407
Will they get enough use out of
it to justify the subscription?

79
00:04:17,948 --> 00:04:20,138
It validates economic assumptions.

80
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:23,378
Can one designer handle five
unlimited clients profitably.

81
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:25,954
What are the actual time costs per client?

82
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:29,128
Does the subscription price
cover costs with healthy margin?

83
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,158
What's the realistic client capacity?

84
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:32,878
One MVP.

85
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:34,918
Multiple models validated efficiently.

86
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:39,006
After one month, they know if the
model works or if it needs adjustment.

87
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:42,813
Let's play with the linking
your thinking example.

88
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:46,616
They could have validated the
economics through a pilot workshop.

89
00:04:46,948 --> 00:04:50,218
Run one cohort of 30 people
at a target price point.

90
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:50,323
Okay.

91
00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:52,106
Customer validation.

92
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:53,726
Does the workshop format work?

93
00:04:53,956 --> 00:04:55,186
Is the content valuable?

94
00:04:55,406 --> 00:04:56,426
Will people complete it?

95
00:04:56,878 --> 00:04:59,631
Economic validation,
does the pricing work?

96
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:02,869
can one person run a cohort
of 30 people profitably?

97
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:04,681
What are the actual time costs?

98
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,833
What does customer acquisition
cost through content marketing?

99
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:11,833
Do customers refer new
customers impact validation?

100
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:14,629
Are people actually improving
their thinking systems?

101
00:05:14,957 --> 00:05:16,937
Are they getting the
outcomes that they came for?

102
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:20,573
One pilot cohort validates the full model.

103
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:23,621
If it works at 30, they can
scale to multiple cohorts.

104
00:05:24,328 --> 00:05:27,688
If it doesn't, they learn what
to fix before investing more.

105
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:32,641
Let's look at how Buy Me once could
have validated their marketplace

106
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:34,561
economics with a curated pilot.

107
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,128
They list 50 products in one category.

108
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,404
Say kitchen items, drive
traffic through content about

109
00:05:40,404 --> 00:05:42,114
buying quality over quantity.

110
00:05:42,757 --> 00:05:43,897
Customer validation.

111
00:05:43,897 --> 00:05:45,607
Will people buy through the platform?

112
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:47,389
Does the curation add value?

113
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:49,759
Do customers trust the recommendations?

114
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:51,723
Economic validation?

115
00:05:51,878 --> 00:05:54,543
What's the conversion rate
from customer to buyer?

116
00:05:54,746 --> 00:05:58,513
What affiliate commission or margin
can they earn per transaction?

117
00:05:58,702 --> 00:06:00,500
What's customer acquisition cost?

118
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,610
Through content marketing?

119
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:06,136
Can organic content drive enough
traffic Impact validation.

120
00:06:06,437 --> 00:06:10,313
Our customers choosing durable products
they wouldn't have found otherwise.

121
00:06:10,514 --> 00:06:12,434
Is this actually reducing waste?

122
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,484
One focus pilot validates whether
their marketplace works before building

123
00:06:17,484 --> 00:06:19,194
out hundreds of product listings.

124
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:22,861
Now apply this to your
economic model validation.

125
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:28,114
Use AI tools to support this and look
for integrated MVP opportunities Can

126
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:32,044
one experiment validate your customer
economic and impact models together?

127
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,747
this could be the most
efficient path forward.

128
00:06:35,777 --> 00:06:39,972
Create your validation plan document as
outlined in the core content section.

129
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:44,623
Create your validation plan document as
outlined in the core content section.

130
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:47,017
What will prove your economic model works?

131
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:49,922
What metrics will show
positive unit economics?

132
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,750
What customer acquisition
cost is acceptable?

133
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:54,794
What conversion rates do you need?

134
00:06:55,244 --> 00:06:59,234
List your experiments to prove these
metrics with clear success criteria.

135
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:03,413
And remember, customer
validation already proved a lot.

136
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:04,282
by now.

137
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:05,662
You know, people will pay.

138
00:07:05,896 --> 00:07:07,216
you know, channels exist.

139
00:07:07,602 --> 00:07:11,502
Now you're proving that the economics
work at the scale you need with

140
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:12,972
the dynamics you're counting on.
