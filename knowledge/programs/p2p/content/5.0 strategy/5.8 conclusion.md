### What You've Built

**[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas and Strategy Model side by side]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
Now that you have completed your strategy model you're in a really strong position. You have a Social Lean Canvas that captures your business model - how you create value for customers, deliver impact, and achieve financial sustainability.

AND you have a strategy model that shows how you'll validate and execute on this business model. Three integrated layers working together. A timeline that fits your constraints and Metrics to prove your assumptions.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Canvas + Strategy Model | Built at your scale | Your roadmap]**

These aren't theoretical documents. These are your working tools. Your roadmap from where you are now to where you're heading.

**Tag line:** **Substantial work done.**

### The Iterative Cycle

**[MAIN PANEL: Cycle diagram showing four steps]**

Now here's what happens next. You execute your strategy. You run experiments. You learn things - some assumptions prove true, others false. Some insights surprise you and open new possibilities.

This learning changes your business model. And when your business model changes, your strategy needs to update as well.

This is the iterative cycle.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Execute → Learn → Update → Execute]**

**Tag line:** **Cycle of learning.**

---

#### Step 1: Map New Insights into Your Canvas

**[MAIN PANEL: Canvas with update highlights]**

As you run experiments and execute your strategy, update your Social Lean Canvas with what you learn. What changed about your customer model? impact model? And economic model?

Map these insights onto your canvas. Keep it current. Don't let it drift from reality.

This keeps your canvas as your source of truth - your latest thinking about how your business model works.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Update as you learn | Keep current | Source of truth]**

Quick updates work better than waiting for major revisions. When you learn something significant, update the canvas that week.

**Tag line:** **Keep canvas current.**

---

#### Step 2: Improve Your Canvas

**[MAIN PANEL: Module 4 improvement frameworks]**

With your updated canvas, work through the improvement process from the Improving your Business Model module. Make your business model as strong as it can be based on what you now know.


**[VISUAL TEXT: Use Module 4 frameworks | Strengthen model | Challenge weak points]**

You can use AI tools to help identify gaps or test logic. But the creative work of improving your model - that's yours. You see how all the pieces fit together.

**Tag line:** **Strengthen your model.**

---

#### Step 3: Plan Your Next Validation Steps

**[MAIN PANEL: Validation planning framework]**

Work through the validation planning steps again. What new assumptions need validating? What experiments should you run next?

Create your updated validation plans for customer, impact, and economic models.

Focus on the highest remaining risks. You've already validated some assumptions. What's the next critical thing you need to prove?

**[VISUAL TEXT: What needs validating next? | Highest risks first | Updated plans]**

**Tag line:** **Plan next validation.**

#### Step 4: Update Your Strategy Model

**[MAIN PANEL: Strategy model with update arrows]**

Take your new validation plans and update your strategy model. What changes in your business model layer? How does that affect your organizational and capital layers?

Rebuild your 2 month detailed plan. Update your 6 month plan. Adjust your 18 month arc if needed.

Your timeline might stretch as you learn. That's fine. You're building at your pace, not holding to some rigid unrealistic schedule.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Update all three layers | Rebuild short-term plan | Your pace]**

This is the cycle. Each time through, your business model gets stronger and your strategy gets clearer. 
**Tag line:** **Update your strategy.**

### When to Iterate

**[MAIN PANEL: Iteration trigger points]**

You don't go through these steps after every experiment. But you do when certain things happen.

**When a major assumption is invalidated.** If a core part of your business model doesn't work, stop and iterate. Don't push forward with a broken model. Fix it or pivot to something new.

**When you discover a significant new opportunity.** If validation reveals something that could make your model much stronger, iterate to integrate it into your business model.

**When you complete a major validation phase.** Customer Discovery done? Big pilot complete? Natural milestone reached? Pause and iterate.

**Your regular strategy review.** Set regular times to step back and assess. Maybe monthly when things are changing fast. Quarterly once you're in execution mode.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Major invalidation | New opportunity | Validation milestone | Regular review]**

This sounds like a lot, but it doesn't need to be. These are not large documents created for an external audience. They are just capturing what is useful for you to do the planning that you need. 

Find the rhythm that works for you.

Use the templates provided to keep clear, well structured high-level view of everything. 

The more you run this iteration process, the faster your will get. Before you know it, this way of thinking about venture building will come naturally to you. 



**Tag line:** **Iterate when it matters.**

### Living Tools

**[MAIN PANEL: Canvas and strategy model in use]**

Your canvas and strategy model are living tools you use constantly.

If you decide to pursue external funding or apply for grants, they form the basis for your pitch. When you're recruiting partners or bringing in contractors, they communicate your vision and plan. If you grow beyond solo, they keep everyone aligned.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Funding pitches | Partner recruitment | Decision framework]**

Even if you stay solo and never raise external capital, these tools keep you aligned with your purpose and focused on what matters. They prevent drift. They help you stay honest about what's working and what's not.

**Tag line:** **Tools for the journey.**

---

### You're Ready

**[MAIN PANEL: Path forward visual]**

You have everything you need. A framework for mapping your business model. Tools for improving it. A process for validating it. A method for building strategy.

The Social Lean Canvas and your strategy model are your companions on this journey. Use them. Update them. Let them evolve with your learning.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Test → Learn → Iterate → Build]**

Now go execute. Test your assumptions. Learn from your experiments. Iterate your model. Build something meaningful.
