# The Improvement Process

Here's how to actually work through improving your impact model.

**First, gather input.** Talk with advisors, experts, and especially people with lived experience. Research organizations doing similar work. Use AI tools to fill gaps in your model. Review the example library for similar impact approaches.

**Second, work through systematically.** Follow your impact model canvas in order: Issue, then Participants, then Activities, then Short-term Outcomes, then Medium-term Outcomes, then Long-term Outcomes, then Impact.

For each box, based on the assessment lenses we just covered and the feedback you've gathered, brainstorm possible changes. Use AI to explore possibilities.

**Third, test ripple effects.** For each idea that looks promising, zoom out.

First, consider the impact model as a whole. Does this change strengthen the causal chain? Does it improve both micro and macro impact?

Then zoom out to your business model. How does this change affect your customer model? For example, different participants might mean different customers.

How does it affect your economic model? Different activities mean different costs. Partnership changes your cost structure.

Is the overall business model stronger with this change?

### Readiness Check

You're ready to move on when you can confidently answer these questions:

Can you articulate the causal chain with confidence - from activities through outcomes to impact?

Have you tested the logic with experts and people with lived experience?

Do you understand the larger system you're operating in?

Have you identified the most efficient intervention points?

If yes, create a list of your core assumptions about this impact model. You'll need these when you start validating.

### Remember: You're Still Early

You're still in the early development of your business model. This doesn't have to be complete or perfect.

There will be lots more time to validate and evolve the impact model as you develop your venture. You'll learn things through testing that you can't know now.

But you want to make sure your impact model is good enough to start validating. There's no point in investing time and effort into testing something that just isn't good enough yet.

The goal is good enough to test, not perfect to launch.

Now let's move to your economic model.
