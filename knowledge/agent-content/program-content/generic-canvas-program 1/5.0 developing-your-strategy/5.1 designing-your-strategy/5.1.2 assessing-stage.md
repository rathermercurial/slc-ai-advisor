## Section 5.1.2: Assessing Your Stage

**Tag line: "Know where you are"**

### Where Are You Now?

The first step to figuring out your strategy - where you go next - is to work out where you currently are.

The Venture Stage Map gives you a simple set of heuristics to understand where you are on the venture development journey.

`[MAIN PANEL: Venture Stage Map diagram]`

It breaks the journey into four simple stages:

**Idea Stage** - you're starting out with a mostly untested new idea.

**Early Stage** - you have some core validation experiments done, maybe a prototype, and have some confidence that you're on the right track.

**Growth Stage** - you have a product or service in market and are starting to deliver revenue and outcomes from your impact model.

**Scale Stage** - you have validated your business model and are ready to scale your venture in a structured, professional way.

### Four Dimensions of Development

The map splits out your customer, impact, and economic models. It also includes an organization section that tracks your organizational development.

`[MAIN PANEL: Highlight the four columns - Customer Model, Impact Model, Economic Model, Organisation]`

This allows you to map your progress across these four dimensions and lets you see when they might be out of balance.

### The Balance Problem

Here's what happens when things get out of balance.

Some entrepreneurs who come from a finance background might over-index on developing the economic model components of the canvas. They build out sophisticated financial models and projections. But they may not have spoken to a single customer yet.

This would put their economic model at growth stage but their customer model at idea stage. And it would mean that the assumptions underpinning their economic model would almost certainly be wrong.

Likewise, if someone comes from a startup background, they might over-index on the customer model, leaving their impact model lagging behind. They push the venture forward with perhaps existential risks remaining in the impact model.

The opposite is often true for people coming in from the nonprofit space. They may massively over-index on the impact model, prioritizing huge investment in impact model development and measurement frameworks. But they have no idea whether their business model can create value for customers.

`[VISUAL TEXT: finance background → economic model ahead | startup background → customer model ahead | nonprofit background → impact model ahead]`

In all of these cases, the Venture Stage Map can stop you getting too far out ahead of your skis on any one part of your business model. It keeps your approach coherent and balanced.

It will also help you understand what parts of your business model need to be prioritized as you develop your strategy to take you forward.

### Introducing Our Example: Toast Ale

To make this concrete, we're going to follow an example throughout this module.

We'll use Toast Ale - a real purpose-driven brewery you can explore in the example library. Toast Ale makes award-winning craft beer from surplus bread, fighting food waste while funding environmental charities with their profits. They're a great example of how a venture can integrate a strong business model with meaningful impact.

`[MAIN PANEL: Toast Ale logo or simple visual]`

But here's what we're going to do: we're going to imagine Toast Ale at the very beginning of their journey. We're going to talk hypothetically about what the founders might have thought and done when they were first starting out at idea stage.

This is not their actual history. We're using Toast Ale as a teaching example because it's a clear, relatable concept that helps illustrate how strategy works.

Think of this as: "If we were building Toast Ale from scratch today, what might that journey look like?"

### Toast Ale at Idea Stage

So let's imagine the founders of Toast Ale at the very beginning.

They've just discovered that forty-four percent of bread is wasted globally. That's a massive amount of food going to landfill, contributing to climate change.

They have an idea: What if we made beer from surplus bread?

The concept is simple. Partner with bakeries to collect their unsold bread. Use it to replace some of the malted barley in the brewing process. Create a great-tasting craft beer. And fund environmental charities with the profits.

`[MAIN PANEL: Simple sketch/diagram of the concept - bread → beer → impact]`

This is our hypothetical starting point. A compelling concept, but completely untested.

Let's assess where the founders are using the Venture Stage Map.

### Stage Assessment

**Customer Model: Idea Stage**

The founders have assumptions about who will buy this beer. Probably craft beer drinkers who care about sustainability. But they haven't spoken to any customers yet. They don't know if people will buy "waste bread beer" or if there's stigma attached to that positioning. They don't know what people will pay, where they'll buy it, or what the unique value proposition needs to be.

The customer model is pure hypothesis.

**Impact Model: Idea Stage**

The founders have a hypothesis about the impact chain. Collect surplus bread, brew it into beer, reduce food waste, fund environmental causes with profits.

But they haven't tested any of this. Can they actually source enough surplus bread? Will bakeries partner with them? How much waste will actually be diverted? What environmental outcomes will the funded charities create?

The impact logic seems sound, but it's untested.

**Economic Model: Idea Stage**

The founders have back-of-napkin numbers. They think they can brew the beer for about the same cost as regular craft beer since bread replaces some expensive malted barley. They assume they can charge craft beer prices. They're guessing at distribution costs.

But these are all guesses. No real data on unit economics, breakeven points, or whether the channels will work.

**Organisation: Idea Stage**

The founders are working on this part-time while keeping their day jobs. Small team, no formal structure, no funding beyond personal savings.

`[MAIN PANEL: Stage Map with Toast Ale plotted - all in Idea Stage column]`

### What This Tells Us

Looking at this stage assessment, everything is balanced - which is good for idea stage. The founders aren't over-developed in any dimension.

But it also tells us what needs to happen next. The biggest risks and uncertainties span all three models. They need to start validating the customer model first - because without customers who will buy the beer, nothing else matters.

But the impact model also has critical assumptions that need testing early. And the economic model assumptions will need validation as the venture progresses.

This stage assessment will guide the validation strategy we develop in the next sections.


### Assess Your Own Stage

Take a moment to assess where your own venture is on this map. Look across all four dimensions:

Your Customer Model - where are you? Idea stage, still discovering? Early stage, with some validation done? Further along?

Your Impact Model - how developed and tested is your theory of change?

Your Economic Model - how much do you actually know about your unit economics and growth potential?

Your Organisation - how structured and resourced are you?

`[VISUAL TEXT: assess each dimension | look for imbalance | identify what needs validation]`

Once you understand where you are, you can start planning where to go next.

In the next section, we'll look at what validation actually means and how to approach it.

`[MAIN PANEL: Transition to next section]`


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
The first step to figuring out your
strategy, where to go next, is to

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,333
work out where you currently are.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,170
The venture stage map gives you a simple
set of heuristics to understand where you

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,850
are on the venture development journey.

5
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:15,056
It breaks the journey
into four simple stages.

6
00:00:15,318 --> 00:00:16,173
Idea stage.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,004
You're starting out with a
mostly untested new idea.

8
00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:23,615
Early stage, you have some core
validation experiments done, maybe a

9
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:28,145
prototype and have some confidence that
you're on the right track growth stage.

10
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:31,924
You have a product or service and
market starting to deliver revenue

11
00:00:31,924 --> 00:00:33,694
and outcomes for your impact model.

12
00:00:34,137 --> 00:00:34,977
And finally, scale.

13
00:00:34,977 --> 00:00:35,577
Stage.

14
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:39,391
You have validated your business model
and you're ready to scale your venture

15
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:41,201
in a structured, professional way.

16
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:45,705
This map splits out your customer
impact and economic models.

17
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:49,494
It also includes an organizational
section that tracks your

18
00:00:49,494 --> 00:00:50,964
organizational development.

19
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:55,262
This allows you to map your progress
across these four dimensions and lets you

20
00:00:55,262 --> 00:00:57,002
see when they might be out of balance.

21
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:00,776
Here's what it can look like when
things do get out of balance.

22
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:03,686
Some entrepreneurs who come
from a finance background might

23
00:01:03,686 --> 00:01:07,346
overindex on developing the economic
model components of the canvas.

24
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:11,340
They build out sophisticated financial
models and projections, but they may not

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,110
have spoken to a single customer yet.

26
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:16,523
This would put their economic
model at growth stage, but their

27
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:18,593
customer model at idea stage.

28
00:01:18,818 --> 00:01:22,838
And it would mean that the assumptions
underpinning their economic model it would

29
00:01:22,838 --> 00:01:26,837
mean that the assumptions underpinning
the economic model would almost certainly

30
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,872
be unvalidated and potentially wrong.

31
00:01:29,932 --> 00:01:30,592
Likewise.

32
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:34,062
If someone comes from a startup
background, they might over index

33
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:37,464
on customer model, leaving their
impact model lagging behind.

34
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:40,985
They push the venture forward
with perhaps existential risks

35
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:42,425
remaining in the impact model.

36
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,260
The opposite is often true for people
coming in from the nonprofit space.

37
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:50,796
They may massively over index on
the impact model, prioritizing huge

38
00:01:50,796 --> 00:01:54,828
investment in impact model development
and measurement frameworks, but they

39
00:01:54,828 --> 00:01:58,458
have no idea whether their business
model can create value for customers.

40
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:02,725
In all of these cases, the venture
stage map can stop you getting out

41
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:06,115
too far ahead of your skis on any
one part of your business model.

42
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:08,668
It keeps your approach
coherent and balanced.

43
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:12,296
It will also help you understand
which parts of your model need

44
00:02:12,296 --> 00:02:15,591
to be prioritized as you develop
your strategy to take you forward.

45
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:20,178
To make this concrete, we're gonna
follow our fictional history of our

46
00:02:20,178 --> 00:02:22,603
real social enterprise example to ale.

47
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,789
to stale.

48
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:27,094
Makes award-winning craft beer
from surplus bread, fighting food

49
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:29,919
waste, while funding environmental
charities with their profits.

50
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,339
They're a great example of how
a venture can integrate a strong

51
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:35,281
business model with meaningful impact.

52
00:02:36,058 --> 00:02:39,221
We're going to imagine toe ale at
the very beginning of their journey.

53
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:42,489
We're gonna talk hypothetically
about what the founders might have

54
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:46,113
thought and done when they were
first starting out at idea stage.

55
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:50,269
Think of this as if we were building
toe stale from scratch today,

56
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:51,971
what might that journey look like?

57
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,384
So let's imagine the founders of
toe stale at the very beginning.

58
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,020
They've just discovered that
40% of bread is wasted globally.

59
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:03,397
It's a massive amount of food going into
landfill, contributing to climate change.

60
00:03:03,802 --> 00:03:04,702
They have an idea.

61
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:06,673
What if we made beer from surplus bread?

62
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:08,315
The concept is simple.

63
00:03:08,585 --> 00:03:11,225
Partner with bakeries to
collect their unsold bread.

64
00:03:11,369 --> 00:03:14,699
Use it to replace some of the malt
barley in the brewing process.

65
00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:19,111
Create a great tasting craft beer and fund
environmental charities with the profits.

66
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:22,393
A compelling concept,
but completely untested.

67
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:26,879
Let's assess where the founders
are using the venture stage map.

68
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:29,535
The customer model is at idea stage.

69
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:32,163
The founders have assumptions
about who would buy the beer.

70
00:03:32,373 --> 00:03:36,603
Probably craft beer drinkers who
care about sustainability, but they

71
00:03:36,603 --> 00:03:38,313
haven't spoken to any customers yet.

72
00:03:38,387 --> 00:03:41,742
They don't know if people will buy
Waste bread, beer,  or if there's

73
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:43,482
stigma attached to that positioning.

74
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,749
They don't know what people will pay,
where they'll buy it, or what the

75
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:49,549
unique value proposition needs to be.

76
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:55,124
The customer model is pure hypothesis
model is also at idea stage.

77
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:58,375
The  founders have a hypothesis
about the impact chain.

78
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,835
Collect surplus bread, brew it into beer.

79
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:04,435
Reduce food waste fund environmental
causes with the profits.

80
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:06,626
But they haven't tested any of this yet.

81
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:09,152
Can they actually source
enough surplus bread?

82
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:10,898
Will bakeries partner with them?

83
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,177
How much waste will actually be diverted?

84
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,843
What environmental outcomes will
the funder charities create?

85
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:20,045
The impact logic seems
sound, but it's untested.

86
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:23,088
model is at idea stage.

87
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:25,579
The founders have back
of the napkin numbers.

88
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:29,651
They think they can brew beer for about
the same cost as regular craft beer.

89
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:33,411
Since bread replaces some of the
expensive malted barley, They assume

90
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:35,271
they can charge craft beer prices.

91
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,550
But these are all guesses.

92
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,092
No real data on unit economics break even
point, or whether the channels will work.

93
00:04:42,078 --> 00:04:45,496
Organization at Idea Stage, the
founders are working on this

94
00:04:45,496 --> 00:04:47,266
part-time while keeping their jobs.

95
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:49,988
Small team, no formal
structure, no funding.

96
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:51,188
Beyond personal savings.

97
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:54,466
Looking at the stage assessment,
everything is balanced,

98
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:56,216
which is good for idea stage.

99
00:04:56,423 --> 00:05:00,089
The founders aren't overdeveloped
in any dimensions,  but it also

100
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:01,889
tells us what needs to happen next.

101
00:05:01,977 --> 00:05:05,187
The biggest risks and uncertainties
span all three models.

102
00:05:05,484 --> 00:05:08,462
They need to start validating the
customer model first,  Because

103
00:05:08,462 --> 00:05:11,042
without customers who will buy
the beer, nothing else matters.

104
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:15,499
But the impact model also has critical
assumptions that need testing early And

105
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:19,384
the economic model assumptions will need
validation as the venture progresses.

106
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,837
This stage assessment will
guide the validation strategy

107
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:24,641
we develop in the next sections.

108
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:28,258
Take a moment to assess where
your venture is on the map.

109
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,265
Look across all four dimensions.

110
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,980
Your customer model, where are you?

111
00:05:32,018 --> 00:05:36,054
Idea stage, still discovering
early stage with some validation.

112
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:38,816
Done further along Your impact model.

113
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:42,977
How developed and tested is your
theory of change, economic model.

114
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:46,637
How much do you actually know about your
unit economics and growth potential.

115
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:50,375
Your organization, how
structured and resourced are you?

116
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:54,744
Once you understand where you are, you
can start planning where to go to next.

117
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,810
In the next section, we'll look
at what validation actually

118
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,433
means and how to approach it.
