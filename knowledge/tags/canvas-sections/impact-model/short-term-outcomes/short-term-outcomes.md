# short-term-outcomes

## Definition
The `short-term-outcomes` tag identifies content about immediate changes in participants, systems, or conditions that result from outputs - typically occurring within 0-1 year of activities.

## Usage Criteria
Apply this tag to content that:
- Defines short-term outcome identification and measurement
- Discusses immediate impact assessment
- Provides frameworks for early outcome tracking
- Analyzes output-outcome relationships

## Always Include When
- Content focuses on immediate change measurement
- Early outcome tracking methodologies
- Short-term impact assessment approaches
- Output-outcome logic analysis

## Never Include When
- Medium or long-term outcome content (use specific outcome tags)
- Output measurement content (use `outputs`)
- Ultimate impact content (use `impact`)

## Required Combinations
- Must include appropriate canvas-sections hierarchy: [impact-model, short-term-outcomes]

## Content Examples
- Short-term outcome measurement frameworks
- Immediate impact assessment methodologies
- Activity-outcome relationship analysis
- Short-term evaluation approaches

## Related Tags
- Parent tags: [impact-model](../impact-model.md)
- Often appears with [outputs](../outputs/outputs.md) (outputs lead to short-term outcomes)
- Often paired with [medium-term-outcomes](../medium-term-outcomes/medium-term-outcomes.md) (progression to medium-term)

## Key Concepts
- Immediate behavior/knowledge changes
- Initial skill development
- Early engagement indicators
- Short-term system changes
- Participant response to activities
