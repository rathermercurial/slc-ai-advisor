## P2P FRAMING

<span style="color:green"> p2p 3.2.3 impact-model 1.webm.02.mp4.webm</span> 



**[MAIN PANEL: Impact Model sections on canvas]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
Now you are going to work through the Core content on Impact Model. This shows how your activities generate positive social or environmental outcomes that create long-term impact.

The Core Framework walks through rigorous impact modeling—issue, participants, activities, outcomes at different time horizons, and ultimate impact. This is the full framework used by social enterprises.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Issue | Participants | Activities | Outcomes | Impact]**

Remember the spectrum we talked about in the Purpose section. You might be building a full impact driven venture with a detailed impact model. Or your purpose might be more personal. After the Core content, we'll show what impact modeling looks like across that full spectrum.

**Tag line:** **Impact at every level.**

## P2P COMMENTARY


<span style="color:green"> p2p 3.2.3 impact-model 2.webm.02.mp4.webm</span> 


**[MAIN PANEL: Spectrum graphic from Purpose section]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just showed you how to build rigorous impact models for social and environmental change. Now let's talk about what this means across the P2P spectrum.

**Tag line:** **Your impact, your way.**

---

### Impact Model as Operationalizing Purpose

**[MAIN PANEL: Purpose box → Impact Model flow]**

Your impact model is how you operationalize your purpose. It captures the logic of how your intentions translate into actual change in the world.

If you're pursuing explicit social or environmental impact, you map it using the framework you just saw—issue through to impact. This gets you beyond hopes and assumptions about positive change. You map the causal chain so you can measure whether it's actually happening.

But if you're not pursuing that kind of impact, you can still use the impact model structure to map your personal journey. What you're trying to achieve, for yourself and the people close to you.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Social impact OR Personal transformation | Both valid]**

Let's look at both.

**Tag line:** **Map your change.**

---

### Example: Ridwell (Social/Environmental Impact)

**[MAIN PANEL: Ridwell Impact Model diagram]**

**Script (spoken):**

Ridwell likely has an impact model that looks something like this - 

**Issue**: Hard-to-recycle household items are filling landfills because of system gaps and inconvenient disposal options.

**Participants**: Household members, Ridwell staff, recycling and reuse partners, broader communities.

**Activities**: Households sort items, Ridwell does bi-weekly doorstep collection, warehouse processing, transportation to specialized partners.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Issue → Participants → Activities → Outcomes]**

**Short-term outcomes**: Items diverted from trash, reduced disposal guilt, increased recycling awareness.

**Medium-term outcomes**: Millions of pounds diverted, expanded partner networks, normalized subscription waste services.

**Long-term outcomes**: Systemic waste reduction, stronger circular economy, policy changes supporting environmental responsibility.

**Impact**: A future where responsible disposal is as convenient as trash, supporting a circular economy with minimal waste.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Causal chain from activities to impact]**

You can see the causal chain—activities lead to measurable short-term changes, which compound into medium-term shifts, which create long-term systemic change, which moves toward the ultimate impact.

**Tag line:** **Map the causal chain.**

---

### Example: Personal Transformation

**[MAIN PANEL: Personal Impact Model diagram]**

**Script (spoken):**

Now, if your purpose isn't about solving a social or environmental problem? What if it's just focused on creating a better future for yourself and your family?

You can still use the impact model structure. It could look something like this:

**Issue**: Feeling trapped in work that doesn't align with your values. Wanting to create freedom and a better life for your family.

**Participants**: You, your family, maybe close collaborators.

**Activities**: Building this Purpose Pivot Venture—creating the business model, validating it, launching it, making it succeed. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Personal issue → Your activities → Your outcomes]**

**Short-term outcomes**: You're out of your suffocating job, You're making progress on the venture. You feel more aligned with your values. You're building new skills.

**Medium-term outcomes**: The venture is generating income. You have more control over your time. Your family sees the change.

**Long-term outcomes**: You've achieved financial independence. You're doing work that matters to you. You've created the freedom you wanted.

**Impact**: You're living a life aligned with your values, with the freedom to choose how you spend your time and the resources to support the people around you.

**[VISUAL TEXT: From trapped to free | From misaligned to purposeful]**

This is a valid use of the impact model. You're mapping how your activities create the change you're seeking—even if that change is personal rather than societal.

**Tag line:** **Personal change counts.**

---

### Design is Never Neutral (Callback)

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Design is Never Neutral"]**

**Script (spoken):**

Remember Design is Never Neutral from the Purpose section? This personal transformation example shows why it matters.

Even if your impact model is "create freedom for myself and my family," you're still encoding values. What kind of freedom? At what cost? With what constraints? How do you want to be in the world as you build this?

**[VISUAL TEXT: Personal impact still encodes values]**

Without being explicit about these things, defaults and incentives will work against them. You could end up with financial success but burned relationships. Or freedom from a job but trapped in a venture that's just as miserable.

Map your personal impact deliberately. It keeps you honest about what you're actually trying to achieve.

**Tag line:** **Encode your values.**

---

### Both Personal and Social

**[MAIN PANEL: Buy Me Once example]**

**Script (spoken):**

Some Purpose Pivot Ventures probably have both—personal transformation and social or environmental impact layered together.

Buy Me Once likely fits this pattern. Building a sustainable business that creates freedom and income, while also creating environmental impact through promoting durable, sustainable products.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Personal + Social | Both valid]**

You don't have to choose one or the other. Just be clear about what you're mapping and why.

**Tag line:** **Impact can layer.**

---

### Practical Guidance

**[MAIN PANEL: Impact Model sections on canvas]**

**Script (spoken):**

Keep it simple on your first pass. Whether you're mapping social impact or personal transformation, just get the basic flow down.

If your impact model is complex—multiple participant groups, multiple causal chains—it'll take more time to develop. That's fine. But make sure you're not adding complexity you don't need. Focus on the impact components that truly align with your purpose.

Check out the P2P Example Library to see different approaches. The Core Example Library has comprehensive social enterprise impact models if you want to go deep.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Simple first | Focus on purpose | Use examples]**

Document your impact model. Capture it in your canvas. This becomes the logic by which you'll prove—to yourself, to funders, to collaborators—that the change you're seeking is actually happening.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,119
Now you're gonna work through
the core content on impact model.

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:08,579
This shows how your activities generate
positive social or environmental

3
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:10,993
outcomes that create long-term impact.

4
00:00:11,123 --> 00:00:15,969
The core framework is gonna walk you
through rigorous impact modeling issues.

5
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:18,284
Participants start again.

6
00:00:20,964 --> 00:00:25,104
Now you're gonna work through
the core content on impact model.

7
00:00:25,554 --> 00:00:30,204
This shows you how your activities
generate positive social or environmental

8
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:32,724
outcomes that create long-term impact.

9
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:36,605
The core framework walks you
through rigorous impact modeling,

10
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:41,412
including issues, participants,
activities, outcomes at different time

11
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:43,272
horizons, and then ultimate impact.

12
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:47,397
This is the full framework
used by social enterprises.

13
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:51,171
Remember the spectrum we talked
about in the purpose section.

14
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:55,908
You might be building a full impact
driven venture with the detailed impact

15
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:58,710
model, or purpose might be more personal.

16
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:03,005
After the core content, we'll show
you what impact modeling might look

17
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:04,955
like across that full spectrum.



p2p 3.2.3 impact-model 2.webm.02.mp4.webm

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,379
The core framework just showed you
to build rigorous impact models

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,299
for social environmental change.

3
00:00:06,593 --> 00:00:11,063
Now, let's talk about what this
means across the P two P spectrum.

4
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:15,319
Your impact model is how you
operationalize your purpose.

5
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:20,236
It captures the logic of how
your intentions translate into

6
00:00:20,236 --> 00:00:21,496
actual change in the world.

7
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:26,747
If you're pursuing explicit social
or environmental impact, you map

8
00:00:26,747 --> 00:00:31,324
it using the framework that we
just saw issues through to impact.

9
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:35,832
This gets beyond hopes and
assumptions about positive change.

10
00:00:35,973 --> 00:00:40,509
You map the causal chain so that you can
measure whether it's actually happening.

11
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:45,285
But if you're not pursuing this kind
of impact, you can still use the impact

12
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:49,390
model structure to map your personal
journey, what you're trying to achieve for

13
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,571
yourself and for the people close to you.

14
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:53,748
Let's look at examples of both.

15
00:00:54,286 --> 00:00:58,822
If we look at rid, well, they
likely have an impact model

16
00:00:58,822 --> 00:01:00,262
that looks something like this.

17
00:01:00,682 --> 00:01:02,392
The issue hard to recycle.

18
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:06,412
Household items are filling up
landfills because of system gaps

19
00:01:06,412 --> 00:01:07,762
and inconvenient disposal option.

20
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:13,498
Participants, household members
rid, well, staff recycling and reuse

21
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:15,778
partners and broader communities.

22
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,178
The activities, household, sort items.

23
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:23,853
Rid, well does biweekly doorstep
collection, warehouse processing,

24
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,983
transport to specialized partners.

25
00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:31,562
The short term outcomes items diverted
from trash, reduced disposal guilt,

26
00:01:31,702 --> 00:01:36,611
increased recycling awareness, the
medium term outcomes, millions of pounds

27
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:41,826
of waste diverted, expanded partner
networks, normalized subscription waste

28
00:01:41,826 --> 00:01:44,346
services, and the long term outcomes.

29
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:48,246
Systemic waste reduction,
strongest circular economy.

30
00:01:48,906 --> 00:01:53,302
Policy changes, supporting environmental
responsibility, and the final impact.

31
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:58,602
A world where responsible disposal
is as convenient as trash.

32
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,396
Supporting a circular
economy with minimal waste.

33
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:07,041
As you can see, the causal chain
activities lead to measurable short-term

34
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:12,787
changes, which compound into medium
term shifts, which create long-term

35
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:16,360
systemic change, which moves the
world towards the ultimate impact.

36
00:02:17,695 --> 00:02:21,325
Now, what if your purpose isn't about
solving a social or environmental problem?

37
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:24,415
What if it's just focused on
creating a better future for

38
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:26,146
yourself and for your family?

39
00:02:26,488 --> 00:02:28,601
You can still use the
impact model structure.

40
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:33,336
It could look something like this, the
issue feeling trapped in work that doesn't

41
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:37,716
align with your values, wanting to create
freedom and a better life for your family

42
00:02:38,436 --> 00:02:44,592
participants, you, your family members,
maybe close collaborators, the activities,

43
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:49,632
building this purpose, pivot venture,
creating the business model, validating

44
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:51,432
it, launching it, making it succeed.

45
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:53,169
Short term outcomes.

46
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:55,449
You're out of your suffocating job.

47
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:57,609
You're making progress in the venture.

48
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,949
You feel more aligned with your values.

49
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:01,389
You're building new skills.

50
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:03,153
Medium term outcomes.

51
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:05,285
The venture is generating income.

52
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:07,445
You have more control over your time.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,111
Your family sees the change
in you, long-term outcomes.

54
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,241
You've achieved financial independence.

55
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:15,041
You're doing work that matters to you.

56
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,261
You've created the
freedom that you wanted.

57
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,988
And then the final impact.

58
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:23,518
You're living a life aligned with your
values, with the freedom to choose how

59
00:03:23,518 --> 00:03:27,152
to spend your time and the resources
to support the people around you.

60
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:30,007
This is a valid use of the impact model.

61
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:33,471
You're mapping how your activities
create the change that you're

62
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:37,191
seeking, even if that change is
personal rather than societal.

63
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:42,138
And remember, in the purpose section we
talked about how design is never neutral.

64
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:46,003
This personal transformation
example shows why this matters.

65
00:03:46,404 --> 00:03:50,462
Even if your impact model is create
freedom for myself and my family.

66
00:03:52,076 --> 00:03:52,481
You're still encoding values.

67
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,026
What kind of freedom at what
cost, with what constraints?

68
00:03:57,296 --> 00:03:59,156
How do you want to be in the world?

69
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:03,631
As you build this without being
explicit about these things, faults

70
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:05,491
and incentives will work against them.

71
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:09,750
You could end up with financial
success, but burned relationships

72
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,219
or freedom from a job, trapped in
a venture that's just as miserable.

73
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,940
Map your personal impact deliberately.

74
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,806
It keeps you honest about what
you're actually trying to achieve.

75
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:26,298
Some P two P ventures probably have both
personal transformation and social or

76
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:28,458
environmental impact layered together.

77
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:33,265
Our example of buy Me once likely
fits into this pattern, building a

78
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:37,675
sustainable business that creates
freedom and income, while also creating

79
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:41,515
environmental impact through promoting
durable, sustainable products.

80
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:44,263
You don't have to choose one or the other.

81
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:47,117
Just be clear about what
you're mapping and why.

82
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,276
Keep it simple on your first pass.

83
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:54,206
Whether you are mapping social
impact or personal transformation,

84
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,940
just get the basic flow down.

85
00:04:56,266 --> 00:05:00,886
If your impact model is complex, multiple
participant groups, multiple causal

86
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:03,496
chains, it'll take more time to develop.

87
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:07,606
That's fine, but make sure you're not
adding complexity that you don't need.

88
00:05:08,243 --> 00:05:12,443
Focus on the impact components
that truly align with your purpose.

89
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:16,967
Check out the P two P example
library to see different approaches.

90
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:21,707
The core example library has comprehensive
social enterprise impact models as well.

91
00:05:21,707 --> 00:05:27,091
If you want to go deep, document your
impact model, capture it in your canvas.

92
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:31,801
This becomes the logic by which
you'll prove to yourself, to funders,

93
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:35,671
to collaborators that the change
you're seeking is actually happening.
