Now you're about to work through the Core content on the Economic Model. This shows how your enterprise turns the value you create for customers into an engine that powers your whole venture—your business and your impact.

The Core Framework walks through channels, revenue, costs, and advantage. How you reach customers at scale, how money works in your model, and where your leverage comes from.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Channels | Revenue | Costs | Advantage]**

After the Core content, we'll come back and talk about what economic models look like for P2P Ventures—solo or small team operations with fundamentally different cost structures and leverage points.

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Economic Model for PPVs"]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just showed you how the economic model works—channels, revenue, costs, and advantage. Now let's talk about what this looks like for a venture like yours.

For for P2P ventures, the economic model can look significantly different from high growth startups or large social enterprises. Every venture will be different, but here are some principles to guide building an economic model that will work for your venture at your scale. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Different economics | P2P principles]**

**Tag line:** **P2P economics.**


---

### Channels for Solo/Small Teams

**[MAIN PANEL: Channel types - What works vs. What doesn't]**

Channels—how you reach and serve customers—matter differently for P2P ventures. Your constraints shape which channels will work well for your business model. 

Like we discussed in customer model, you probably can't afford a direct sales team. And you won't be able to do high-touch enterprise sales where you're on calls all day. You also likely won't be able afford expensive paid acquisition channels at scale. These all require resources you probably won't have.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Can't do | Direct sales | High-touch | Expensive acquisition]**

What does work for p2p scale? 
- Content-driven channels. SEO, blog posts, YouTube, AI discovery. 
- Community and word-of-mouth acquisition where customers you have bring you more customers. 
- Self-serve digital channels. 
- Curation platforms like Product Hunt, app stores and marketplaces.
- Strategic partnerships that don't require constant input and management.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Works | Content | Community | Self-serve | Platforms]**

Here's the key test: "Can this channel work while you sleep?" You need async, automated, or community-driven channels. You can't be manually selling every customer or you'll never scale beyond your own time.

**Tag line:** **Async channels win.**

---

### Revenue Models That Work Solo

**[MAIN PANEL: Revenue model comparison]**

Some revenue models work better than others when you're on your own.

**Subscription revenue** is predictable and recurring and it compounds over time. You build the product once, and revenue keeps coming in month after month. Each new customer adds to your base.

One-time sales can be lumpy. They require constant customer acquisition. You're always hunting the next sale. Revenue spikes when you sell, then drops until you sell again.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Subscriptions | Recurring | Predictable vs. One-time | Lumpy | Constant hustle]**

Beware revenue models that require constant manual work. Consulting hours, one-off services, custom builds. These don't scale—you're just selling your time. When you stop working, revenue stops.

Look for models with compounding effects. Each customer adds to the base. Each piece of content brings more organic traffic. Each community member attracts more members. You're building an engine, not just making individual sales.

**Tag line:** **Recurring beats one-time.**


---

### Keep Costs Lean

**[MAIN PANEL: Cost comparison - Traditional vs. P2P]**

Let's talk about cost structure. P2P cost models are generally leaner than traditional ventures.

No office. No staff initially. You're using cloud based infrastructure. AI tools instead of hiring. Outsourcing or automating work that doesn't need your direct touch.

**[VISUAL TEXT: No office | Cloud tools | AI augments | Lean baseline]**

This lean baseline creates two advantages. First, you can validate your model while still employed, because you can achieve more with less. Second, your revenue doesn't need to be massive to be sustainable.

Once there up and running, a traditional startup might need $50k or more in monthly revenue just to cover basic overheads—office, staff, benefits, all of it. A P2P venture might need just $5k per month to be viable, because the cost structure is so much leaner.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Lower overhead = Lower revenue threshold]**

This changes what "scale" means for you. You're not trying to support 20 employees and an office lease. You're trying to support yourself and build something sustainable. It's a different game entirely.

**Tag line:** **Lean by design.**

---

### Finding Your Leverage (Advantage)

**[MAIN PANEL: Leverage types diagram]**

The Core Framework showed you the advantage section—where you identify the leverage that makes your model work. For P2P ventures, certain types of leverage are particularly powerful.

These include - 
**Productization**: One-to-many instead of one-to-one. Courses instead of one-on-one consulting. SaaS instead of custom development. You build it once, then sell it many times. Your work compounds.

**Automation replacing manual work**: Customer support handled by AI chatbots. Automated onboarding sequences. Email workflows that nurture customers without you having touch each one. AI handling tasks that used to need people.

**Low or zero marginal costs digital products**: like software as a service - Each additional customer costs almost nothing to serve. Your tenth customer costs the same to serve as your thousandth.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Productization | Automation | Zero marginal cost]**

**Building on top of existing digital platforms** -   Shopify, Substack, Stripe. They handle infrastructure, payments, hosting and security. You can focus on your core value creation, and they handle everything else.

**Community as growth engine**: Members recruit other members. They create content. They provide support to each other. The community becomes the acquisition channel and the support system.

**Personal brand as your moat**: You can't be replicated. Your authentic voice, your specific expertise, your unique perspective—that's an advantage to leverage. No one else can be you.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Platform leverage | Community engine | Personal brand]**

Let's look at an example:

**[MAIN PANEL: Plausible Analytics economic model]**

Plausible Analytics shows what clean P2P venture economics look like in practice.

**Channels**: 
- Self-serve digital signup. No sales team. 
- Content marketing through blog posts about privacy and web analytics. 
- Word-of-mouth in developer communities where people share tools they love.

**Revenue**: 
- Subscription model. 
- Recurring monthly revenue per customer. 
- Plans from $9 to $150+ per month depending on traffic volume.

**Costs**: 
- Cloud hosting for the infrastructure.
- Time contributed by the founders.
- Minimal overhead beyond that.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Self-serve | Subscriptions | Cloud costs | Lean]**

**Advantage**: There leverage shows up in several places:
- Low marginal costs—it's a SaaS model, so each additional customer costs pennies in hosting to serve.
- Platform leverage—they built on existing cloud infrastructure rather than managing their own servers.
- Personal brand—the founders built reputation in the privacy and open-source space. People trust them.
- Product differentiation—they offer a simple, privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics. They have very clear positioning.

They don't need millions of customers to succeed. A few thousand paying subscribers at $9 to $19 per month creates a sustainable business for a small team. That's the power of the right economic model.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Thousands, not millions | Sustainable at small scale]**

**Tag line:** **Leverage enables small.**

### Use the Typology and AI Tools

**[MAIN PANEL: Venture typology categories]**

The Venture Typology shows different economic model patterns across the six categories. Software & AI ventures have different economics than Local & Regenerative ventures. Different cost structures, different revenue models, different sources of leverage.

Browse through the typology to see patterns that might fit your model. See how ventures similar to yours have structured their economics.

**[VISUAL TEXT: 6 categories | Different economics | Pattern recognition]**

Use AI tools to explore your economic model. You can prompt LLMs for monetization strategies you haven't considered. Channel ideas specific to your venture type. Ways to optimize costs. Leverage points you might be missing.

AI is good at pattern matching and brainstorming—so use AI tools to expand what you're considering beyond your first ideas.

**Tag line:** **Explore patterns.**

---

### Practical Guidance

**[MAIN PANEL: Economic Model sections on canvas]**

Keep it high-level on this first pass through the canvas. Main channels, key revenue streams, major costs, primary leverage points. Just the shape of your economic model.

We'll go deeper in Module 2 where you'll improve your whole business model. There's detailed economic model work coming—pricing strategies, customer acquisition cost, lifetime value, unit economics, all of that. For now, just sketch the outline so you can see if the basic structure holds together.

**[VISUAL TEXT: High-level first | Details in Section 4]**

Check the P2P Example Library for different economic model approaches. The Core Example Library shows comprehensive models across different venture types and scales as well.

Document what you have in your canvas. This becomes your economic hypothesis—the model you'll test and refine as you validate.

This shows how your enterprise turns
the value you create for customers

00:00:13,778 --> 00:00:18,428
The core framework walks you through
channels, revenue, costs, and advantage.

After the core content, we'll come
back and talk about what economic

8
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:33,042
models look like for P two P ventures,
specifically solo or small team

9
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:37,079
operations with fundamentally different
cost structures and leverage points.




p2p 3.2.4 economic-model 2.webm.02.mp4.webm



1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
The core framework just showed
you how the economic model works,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,100
channels, revenue costs, and advantage.

3
00:00:06,344 --> 00:00:10,500
Now let's talk about what this
looks like for a venture like yours.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,960
For P two P ventures, the economic
model can look significantly different

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,467
from that of a high growth startup
or a large social enterprise.

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,639
Every venture will be different, but
here are some principles to guide

7
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:27,109
building an economic model that will
work for your venture at your scale

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,550
Channels, how you reach
and serve customers.

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,181
They matter differently For P
two P ventures, your constraints

10
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:38,328
shape, which channels will work
well for your business model.

11
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:44,303
Like we discussed in customer model, you
probably can't afford a direct sales team.

12
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:47,783
You won't be able to do high
touch enterprise sales where

13
00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:49,108
you are on calls all day.

14
00:00:49,894 --> 00:00:53,464
You'll also likely won't be
able to afford expensive paid

15
00:00:53,464 --> 00:00:55,204
acquisition channels at scale.

16
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,592
These all require resources
you probably won't have.

17
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:00,953
What does work for two P scale then?

18
00:01:01,871 --> 00:01:07,935
Content driven channels, SEO, blog
posts, YouTube, AI discovery community

19
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:12,144
and word of mouth acquisition, where
customers you already have bring in more

20
00:01:12,144 --> 00:01:14,939
customers,  self-serve, digital channels.

21
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,559
Curation platforms like product
hunt, app stores and marketplaces,

22
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,320
strategic partnerships that don't
require constant input and management.

23
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:28,165
Here's the key test.

24
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:30,265
Can this channel work while you sleep?

25
00:01:30,588 --> 00:01:34,675
You need async automated or
community driven channels

26
00:01:34,705 --> 00:01:38,695
You can't be manually selling
everything to every customer, or you'll

27
00:01:38,695 --> 00:01:40,555
never scale beyond your own time.

28
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,836
Some revenue models work better
than others when you're on

29
00:01:44,836 --> 00:01:46,336
your own or in a small team.

30
00:01:46,878 --> 00:01:51,258
Subscription revenue is predictable and
recurring and it compounds over time.

31
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:55,675
You build a product once the revenue
keeps coming in month after month,

32
00:01:55,705 --> 00:01:57,620
each new customer adds to your base.

33
00:01:58,703 --> 00:01:59,213
One time.

34
00:01:59,213 --> 00:02:00,323
Sales can be lumpy.

35
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:03,053
They require constant
customer acquisition.

36
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,273
You're always hunting for the next sale.

37
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:08,808
Revenue spikes when you sell, and
then it drops until you sell again.

38
00:02:09,188 --> 00:02:13,018
Okay, Beware revenue models that
require constant manual work,

39
00:02:13,498 --> 00:02:18,058
consulting hours, one-off services
custom builds, these don't scale.

40
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,820
You're just selling your time.

41
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:22,981
When you stop working,
revenue stops as well.

42
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:28,463
Look for models with compounding
effects, each customer adds to the base.

43
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:31,973
Each piece of content brings
in more organic traffic.

44
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:35,153
Each community member
attracts more members.

45
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:39,503
You're building an engine, not
just making individual sales.

46
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,274
Let's talk about cost structure.

47
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:46,925
P two P cost models are generally
leaner than traditional ventures.

48
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:49,051
No office, no staff.

49
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:53,499
Initially, you're using cloud-based
infrastructure AI tools instead of

50
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:58,342
hiring, outsourcing, or automating work
that doesn't need your direct touch.

51
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:01,195
This lean baseline creates two advantages.

52
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:04,869
Firstly, you can validate your model
while you're still employed because

53
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:07,479
you can achieve more with less time.

54
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:11,289
Second, your revenue doesn't
need to be massive in order

55
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:12,489
for you to be sustainable.

56
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:16,946
Once they're up and running, a
traditional startup might need

57
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:21,956
$50,000 or more in monthly revenue
just to cover basic overheads,

58
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,326
offers, staff benefits, all of it.

59
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:30,209
A P two P venture might just need $5,000
per month to be viable or less because

60
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,024
their cost structure is so much leaner.

61
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:35,479
This changes what scale means for you.

62
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,199
You are not trying to support 20
employees and an office lease.

63
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:42,536
You're trying to support yourself
to build something sustainable.

64
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:44,628
It's a different game entirely.

65
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:50,364
The core framework showed you the
advantage section where you identify

66
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,404
the leverage that makes your model work.

67
00:03:52,762 --> 00:03:56,842
For P two P Ventures, certain types
of leverage are particularly powerful.

68
00:03:57,179 --> 00:04:02,279
These include productization one to
many instead of one-to-one courses

69
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:05,053
instead of one-on-one consulting SaaS.

70
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,933
Instead of custom
development, build it once.

71
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:08,516
Sell it.

72
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:13,367
Many times your work compounds
automation replacing manual work,

73
00:04:13,697 --> 00:04:15,437
customer support, handled by ai.

74
00:04:15,437 --> 00:04:15,617
Chat bott.

75
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:21,257
Automated onboarding sequences, email
workflows that nurture customers

76
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:23,237
without you having to touch each one.

77
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:28,776
AI handling tasks that used to need
people, low or zero marginal cost.

78
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:31,146
Digital products like
software as a service.

79
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:34,476
Each additional customer costs
almost nothing for you to serve.

80
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:38,672
Your 10th customer costs the
same as your thousandth customer.

81
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:44,018
Build on top of existing digital
platforms, Shopify, substack, Stripe.

82
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:48,008
They handle infrastructure,
payments, hosting and security.

83
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:52,288
You can focus on core value creation
and they can handle everything else.

84
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:52,618
Okay.

85
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:54,938
Community is a growth engine.

86
00:04:55,143 --> 00:04:56,853
Members recruit other members.

87
00:04:57,033 --> 00:05:00,273
They create content, they
provide support for each other.

88
00:05:00,573 --> 00:05:04,533
The community becomes the acquisition
channel and the support system.

89
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:07,529
finally, personal brand is your moat.

90
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,329
You can't be replicated.

91
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:13,618
Your authentic voice, your
specific expertise, your unique

92
00:05:13,618 --> 00:05:18,448
perspective, that's an advantage
to leverage no one else can be you.

93
00:05:19,378 --> 00:05:20,698
Let's look at an example.

94
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:25,408
Plausible analytics show what
clean P two P venture economics

95
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,131
can look like in practice channels.

96
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:29,646
Self-serve.

97
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:34,566
Digital signup, no sales team,
content marketing through blog posts

98
00:05:34,596 --> 00:05:36,876
about privacy and web analytics.

99
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:41,147
Word of mouth In developer communities
where people share tools, they

100
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:44,328
love revenue subscription model.

101
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:48,764
Recurring monthly revenue per
customer plans from nine to $19 per

102
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:51,554
month, depending on volume costs.

103
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:53,804
Cloud hosting for the infrastructure.

104
00:05:53,984 --> 00:05:59,131
Time contributed by the founders,
minimal overhead beyond that Advantage.

105
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:03,225
Their leverage shows up in several
places, low marginal costs.

106
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:07,669
It's a SaaS model, so each additional
customer costs them pennies and

107
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:10,342
hosting to serve platform leverage.

108
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:13,432
They built on existing cloud
infrastructure rather than

109
00:06:13,432 --> 00:06:14,812
managing their own servers.

110
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:16,355
Personal brand.

111
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:20,057
The founders built really good
reputations in the privacy and open

112
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:21,887
source space, and people trust them.

113
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,835
Product differentiation.

114
00:06:24,165 --> 00:06:28,875
They offer a simple, privacy focused
alternative to Google Analytics, and

115
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,525
they have very clear positioning.

116
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,439
They don't need millions of
customers in order to succeed.

117
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:39,796
A few thousand paying subscribers
at nine to $19 per month creates a

118
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:41,866
sustainable business for a small team.

119
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:44,892
That's the power of the
right economic model.

120
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,395
The venture typology model shows
different economic model patterns

121
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:52,015
across the six categories.

122
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:56,005
Software and AI ventures have
different economics to local

123
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:56,845
and regenerative venture.

124
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:00,257
Different cost structures,
different revenue models,

125
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:01,757
different sources of leverage.

126
00:07:02,097 --> 00:07:05,427
Browse through the typology to see
patterns that might fit your model.

127
00:07:05,997 --> 00:07:09,002
See how ventures similar to yours
have structured their economic.

128
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,998
Use AI tools to explore
your economic model.

129
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:17,558
You can prompt LMS for monetization
strategies you haven't considered

130
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,639
channel ideas specific to your
venture type ways to optimize costs,

131
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,924
leverage points that might be missing.

132
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:27,994
AI is good at pattern
matching and brainstorming.

133
00:07:28,204 --> 00:07:32,944
So use AI tools to expand what you're
considering beyond your first ideas.

134
00:07:34,106 --> 00:07:34,916
Keep it high level.

135
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:39,416
For this first pass through the canvas,
main channels, key revenue streams,

136
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:44,336
major costs, primary leverage points,
just the shape of your economic model.

137
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:45,576
We'll go deeper.

138
00:07:45,576 --> 00:07:49,056
In module two, we'll improve
your whole business model.

139
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:52,441
There's detailed economic model
work coming, pricing strategies.

140
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:57,743
Customer acquisition costs, lifetime
value, unit economics, all of that.

141
00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:01,708
But for now, just sketch the
outline so that you can see if the

142
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,510
basic structure holds together.

143
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,700
Check the P two P example library for
different economic model approaches.

144
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,960
The core example library shows
comprehensive models across different

145
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,150
venture types at scale as well.

146
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:17,761
Document what you have in your canvas.

147
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:21,105
This becomes your economic
hypothesis, the model you'll

148
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:23,466
test and refine as you validate.
