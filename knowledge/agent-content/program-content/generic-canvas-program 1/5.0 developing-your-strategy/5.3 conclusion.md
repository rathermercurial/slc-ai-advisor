## Section 5.3: Conclusion

### [note for Rowan -  this is a copy of the P2P conclusion script with a reference to being "solo" at the end removed. The video may be in descript in the p2p section]

### What You've Built

**[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas and Strategy Model side by side]**

**Script (spoken):**
<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
Now that you have completed your strategy model you're in a really strong position. You have a Social Lean Canvas that captures your business model - how you create value for customers, deliver impact, and achieve financial sustainability.

AND you have a strategy model that shows how you'll validate and execute on this business model. Three integrated layers working together. A timeline that fits your constraints and Metrics to prove your assumptions.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Canvas + Strategy Model | Built at your scale | Your roadmap]**

These aren't theoretical documents. These are your working tools. Your roadmap from where you are now to where you're heading.

**Tag line:** **Substantial work done.**

---

### The Iterative Cycle

**[MAIN PANEL: Cycle diagram showing four steps]**

Now here's what happens next. You execute your strategy. You run experiments. You learn things - some assumptions prove true, others false. Some insights surprise you and open new possibilities.

This learning changes your business model. And when your business model changes, your strategy needs to update as well.

This is the iterative cycle.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Execute → Learn → Update → Execute]**

**Tag line:** **Cycle of learning.**

---

#### Step 1: Map New Insights into Your Canvas

**[MAIN PANEL: Canvas with update highlights]**

As you run experiments and execute your strategy, update your Social Lean Canvas with what you learn. What changed about your customer model? impact model? And economic model?

Map these insights onto your canvas. Keep it current. Don't let it drift from reality.

This keeps your canvas as your source of truth - your latest thinking about how your business model works.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Update as you learn | Keep current | Source of truth]**

Quick updates work better than waiting for major revisions. When you learn something significant, update the canvas that week.

**Tag line:** **Keep canvas current.**

---

#### Step 2: Improve Your Canvas

**[MAIN PANEL: Module 4 improvement frameworks]**

With your updated canvas, work through the improvement process from the Improving your Business Model module. Make your business model as strong as it can be based on what you now know.


**[VISUAL TEXT: Use Module 4 frameworks | Strengthen model | Challenge weak points]**

You can use AI tools to help identify gaps or test logic. But the creative work of improving your model - that's yours. You see how all the pieces fit together.

**Tag line:** **Strengthen your model.**

---

#### Step 3: Plan Your Next Validation Steps

**[MAIN PANEL: Validation planning framework]**

Work through the validation planning steps again. What new assumptions need validating? What experiments should you run next?

Create your updated validation plans for customer, impact, and economic models.

Focus on the highest remaining risks. You've already validated some assumptions. What's the next critical thing you need to prove?

**[VISUAL TEXT: What needs validating next? | Highest risks first | Updated plans]**

**Tag line:** **Plan next validation.**

---

#### Step 4: Update Your Strategy Model

**[MAIN PANEL: Strategy model with update arrows]**

Take your new validation plans and update your strategy model. What changes in your business model layer? How does that affect your organizational and capital layers?

Rebuild your 2 month detailed plan. Update your 6 month plan. Adjust your 18 month arc if needed.

Your timeline might stretch as you learn. That's fine. You're building at your pace, not holding to some rigid unrealistic schedule.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Update all three layers | Rebuild short-term plan | Your pace]**

This is the cycle. Each time through, your business model gets stronger and your strategy gets clearer. 
**Tag line:** **Update your strategy.**

---

### When to Iterate

**[MAIN PANEL: Iteration trigger points]**

You don't go through these steps after every experiment. But you do when certain things happen.

**When a major assumption is invalidated.** If a core part of your business model doesn't work, stop and iterate. Don't push forward with a broken model. Fix it or pivot to something new.

**When you discover a significant new opportunity.** If validation reveals something that could make your model much stronger, iterate to integrate it into your business model.

**When you complete a major validation phase.** Customer Discovery done? Big pilot complete? Natural milestone reached? Pause and iterate.

**Your regular strategy review.** Set regular times to step back and assess. Maybe monthly when things are changing fast. Quarterly once you're in execution mode.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Major invalidation | New opportunity | Validation milestone | Regular review]**

This sounds like a lot, but it doesn't need to be. These are not large documents created for an external audience. They are just capturing what is useful for you to do the planning that you need. 

Find the rhythm that works for you.

Use the templates provided to keep clear, well structured high-level view of everything. 

The more you run this iteration process, the faster your will get. Before you know it, this way of thinking about venture building will come naturally to you.

### You're Ready

**[MAIN PANEL: Path forward visual]**

You have everything you need. A framework for mapping your business model. Tools for improving it. A process for validating it. A method for building strategy.

The Social Lean Canvas and your strategy model are your companions on this journey. Use them. Update them. Let them evolve with your learning.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Test → Learn → Iterate → Build]**

Now go execute. Test your assumptions. Learn from your experiments. Iterate your model. Build something meaningful.

here's what happens next.

13
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:38,709
You execute on your strategy.

14
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,346
you run the experiments you have planned.

15
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:42,536
You learn things.

16
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:45,245
Some assumptions prove true others false.

17
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:49,655
Some insights surprise you and
others create new possibilities.

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,117
This learning changes your business model,
And when your business model changes,

19
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:56,471
your strategy needs to update as well.

20
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,035
This is an iterative cycle.

21
00:00:59,748 --> 00:01:03,827
As you run experiments and execute
on your strategy, update your social

22
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:05,537
lean canvas with what you've learned.

23
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,703
What changed about your customer model,
impact model, and economic model?

24
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:12,251
Map these insights into your canvas.

25
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:13,121
Keep it current.

26
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:14,831
Don't let it drift from reality.

27
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:18,551
This keeps your canvas as
your single source of truth.

28
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:22,061
Your latest thinking about
how your business model works.

29
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:26,368
Quick updates to it work better
than waiting for major revisions.

30
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:29,982
When you learn something
significant, update the canvas that

31
00:01:29,982 --> 00:01:32,698
week  with your updated canvas.

32
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:36,748
Work through the improvement process from
the improving your business model module.

33
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:39,354
Make your business model
as strong as it can be.

34
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:40,695
Based on what you now know.

35
00:01:41,404 --> 00:01:46,468
You can use AI tools to help you identify
gaps and test logic, but the creative work

36
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:48,478
of improving your model, that's yours.

37
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:50,818
You see how all the pieces fit together?

38
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:54,866
Once you've worked through improving
work through the validation

39
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:58,851
planning steps, again,  what new
assumptions need validating What

40
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:00,651
experiments should you run next?

41
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:05,886
Create your updated validation plans
for customer impact and economic models

42
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:08,241
Focus on the highest remaining risks.

43
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,076
You will have already
validated some assumptions.

44
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,620
What's the next critical
thing that you need to prove?

45
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:18,475
And then take your new validation
plans and update your strategy model.

46
00:02:18,754 --> 00:02:20,554
What changes in your business model layer?

47
00:02:20,954 --> 00:02:23,894
How does that affect your
organization and capital layers?

48
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,502
Rebuild your two month detailed plan.

49
00:02:26,622 --> 00:02:28,242
Update your six month plan.

50
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:30,612
Adjust your 18 month arc if needed.

51
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,291
Your timeline might stretch as you learn.

52
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,071
That's fine.

53
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:38,795
Your building at your pace, not holding
to some rigid, unrealistic schedule.

54
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:44,225
Each time through your business model gets
stronger and your strategy gets clearer.

55
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:49,068
to be clear, you don't go through
these steps after every experiment.

56
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:54,764
You do when certain things happen, such
as when a major assumption is invalidated.

57
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:58,623
If a core part of the model
doesn't work, stop iterate.

58
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:02,793
Don't push forward with a broken model,
fix it, or pivot to something new.

59
00:03:03,277 --> 00:03:07,268
also, when you discover a significant
new opportunity, if validation

60
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:10,178
reveals something that could make
your model much, much stronger.

61
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:13,989
Iterate and integrate this into
your new business model design.

62
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:19,208
Also, when you complete a major
validation phase, if customer discovery

63
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:23,529
is finished, A big pilot is complete,
natural milestones are reached.

64
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:26,589
Pause and iterate and go
through the steps again.

65
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:28,152
And finally.

66
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:32,529
Make sure to have regular strategy
review sessions, set regular times

67
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:37,299
to step back and assess maybe monthly
when things are changing fast in the

68
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:41,004
early days, and then perhaps quarterly
once you're in execution mode.

69
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:45,625
I know this sounds like a lot, but
it doesn't really need to be, these

70
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,255
aren't large documents that you're
creating for an external audience.

71
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,744
They're just capturing what's
useful for you to do the

72
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:53,974
planning that you need to do.

73
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:56,617
So find a rhythm that works best for you.

74
00:03:57,076 --> 00:04:01,062
Use the templates provided to keep
it clear and have a well structured

75
00:04:01,062 --> 00:04:02,562
high level view of everything.

76
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:07,146
The more often you run this iteration
process, the faster you will get at it.

77
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:08,005
Before you know it.

78
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:11,130
This way of thinking about venture
building will come naturally to you.

79
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:12,903
There you go.

80
00:04:12,963 --> 00:04:14,193
You have everything you need.

81
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:18,305
A framework for mapping your business
model, tools for improving it,

82
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:21,935
a process for validating it, and
a method for building strategy.

83
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:26,155
The social link canvas and your strategy
model are your companions on this journey.

84
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,806
Use them, update them.

85
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,183
Let them evolve with your learning.

86
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:30,655
Now.

87
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:31,465
Go execute.

88
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:35,875
Test your assumptions, learn from
your experiments, iterate your model,

89
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:37,525
and go build something meaningful.
