# Content Tags

This section contains all tags related to content categorization - the catch-all tag category that describes the type of document and the kind of content it contains. These tags can be applied to any content in the knowledge base as a way of describing what it is and how it functions within the SLC framework.

## Structure Overview

### Examples & Studies
- [Canvas Example](canvas-example.md) - Complete Social Lean Canvas examples from real ventures
- [Case Study](case-study.md) - Detailed analysis of venture development and application

### Tools & Frameworks  
- [Template](template.md) - Structured formats and guides for creating content
- [Concept](concept.md) - Theoretical foundations and intellectual frameworks
- [Strategy Model](strategy-model.md) - Strategic frameworks and implementation models
- [Experiment Test](experiment-test.md) - Testing methodologies and validation approaches

### Reference Materials
- [Lexicon Entry](lexicon-entry.md) - Definitions and terminology explanations
- [Resource](resource.md) - Supporting materials and references
- [Link](link.md) - External connections and web resources
- [Report](report.md) - Research findings and analytical summaries

### Administrative
- [Design](design.md) - Knowledge base structure and design decisions
- [Design Note](design-note.md) - Specific design considerations and rationale
- [Prompt](prompt.md) - AI/LLM interaction prompts and instructions
- [Admin](admin.md) - Administrative and operational content

## Purpose of Content Tags

**Content tags serve as the primary descriptor system for:**

1. **Document Type Classification**: Immediately identifying what kind of document someone is looking at
2. **Content Format Recognition**: Understanding how the content should be used or applied
3. **Search and Discovery**: Enabling efficient filtering and finding of specific content types
4. **LLM Context Setting**: Providing language models with clear context about content purpose and application
5. **Knowledge Base Navigation**: Helping users understand content relationships and hierarchies

## Usage Rules

1. **Universal Application**: Content tags can be applied to any document in the knowledge base
2. **Multiple Tags Allowed**: Documents can have multiple content tags when appropriate
3. **Primary Descriptor**: At least one content tag should be included for every document
4. **Hierarchical Combination**: Content tags work alongside canvas-section, venture-stage, and venture-type tags

## Content Tag Characteristics

### Flexibility
- **Cross-cutting**: Can be applied regardless of canvas section or venture type
- **Combinable**: Multiple content tags can describe complex documents
- **Evolutionary**: New content tags can be added as the knowledge base grows

### Descriptive Power
- **Functional**: Describes what the content does or how it's used
- **Structural**: Indicates the format and organization of content
- **Contextual**: Provides information about content purpose and application

### Integration
- **Framework Agnostic**: Content tags work with all other tag categories
- **Search Optimized**: Enable efficient querying and filtering
- **LLM Friendly**: Provide clear context for AI-assisted navigation and responses

## Common Tag Combinations

### Educational Content
- `concept` + `lexicon-entry` = Definitional concept explanations
- `case-study` + `canvas-example` = Real-world application examples
- `template` + `concept` = Structured learning materials

### Practical Applications
- `strategy-model` + `experiment-test` = Implementation frameworks
- `resource` + `template` = Supporting tools and guides
- `canvas-example` + `case-study` = Complete venture analysis

### Administrative Functions
- `design` + `admin` = Knowledge base management
- `prompt` + `design-note` = AI interaction development
- `link` + `resource` = External reference management

## Guidelines for Content Tag Usage

### For Content Creators
- Choose tags that best describe the document's primary function
- Use multiple tags when content serves multiple purposes
- Consider how users will search for and use the content
- Ensure tags accurately reflect content type and purpose

### For Knowledge Base Users
- Use content tags to filter searches and find specific types of materials
- Combine with other tag categories for precise content discovery
- Understand tag meanings to set appropriate expectations for content

### For LLM Integration
- Content tags provide essential context for appropriate responses
- Help determine how to present and apply knowledge base content
- Enable intelligent routing to relevant supporting materials
- Support contextual understanding of document purpose and scope

## Evolution and Maintenance

### Adding New Content Tags
- Identify gaps in current categorization system
- Ensure new tags serve distinct purposes
- Follow established naming conventions
- Create comprehensive definition files

### Tag Refinement
- Monitor usage patterns and effectiveness
- Adjust definitions based on actual usage
- Maintain consistency across the knowledge base
- Update related documentation when tags evolve

This flexible content tag system ensures that every piece of content in the SLC Knowledge Base is properly categorized and easily discoverable, while providing essential context for both human users and AI systems interacting with the knowledge base.
