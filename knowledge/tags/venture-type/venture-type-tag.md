# venture-type

## Definition
The `venture-type` tag is the parent tag for all venture classification and typology tags. It identifies content that categorizes or classifies social enterprises across multiple dimensions including impact areas, revenue models, industries, legal structures, funding sources, and impact mechanisms.

## Usage Criteria
Apply this tag to content that:
- Classifies ventures by type, category, or characteristics
- Provides venture typology frameworks and taxonomies
- Analyzes venture types and business model patterns
- Compares different types of social enterprises
- Discusses venture classification methodologies

## Always Include When
- Any venture-type sub-category tag is used
- Content about venture classification systems
- Venture type analysis and comparison
- Business model type discussions
- Venture taxonomy development

## Never Include When
- General business content not focused on venture types
- Individual venture examples without type classification
- Non-venture content (use appropriate primary tags instead)

## Required Combinations
- Must be included when any venture-type sub-tag is used
- Often combined with canvas section tags for type-specific guidance
- May combine with venture stage tags for type-stage intersections
