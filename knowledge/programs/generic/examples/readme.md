# Generic Program Venture Examples

Real-world venture examples demonstrating how the Social Lean Canvas framework applies to actual social enterprises. These examples help entrepreneurs understand practical application, learn best practices, and gain inspiration for their own ventures.

## Overview

The Generic program example library contains **8 venture examples** spanning multiple sectors, impact areas, and business models. Each example provides:

- Complete 11-section Social Lean Canvas
- Detailed Impact Model (7-step causality chain)
- Analysis report explaining the venture's business model and impact approach that is structured around the canvas and impact model sections

**Purpose:** Enable entrepreneurs to see how ventures similar to theirs have mapped Customer, Impact, and Economic models, providing both templates and inspiration. They allow AI Advisor to find relevant examples to suggest users look at, as well as to source venture specific advice to give directly to users.

## How to Use This Library

### For the AI Advisor

**Selection Matrix Filtering:**
Before semantic search, filter examples by venture dimensions to find the most relevant matches:

1. **Impact Area:** climate, biodiversity, health, education, employment, etc.
2. **Impact Mechanism:** education-awareness, policy-advocacy, direct-service, product-service-impact, systems-change
3. **Legal Structure:** standard-limited-company, benefit-corporation, nonprofit, cooperative
4. **Revenue Source:** product-sales, service-fees, membership-dues, licensing-royalty, grants
5. **Funding Source:** bootstrapped, traditional-investment, impact-investment, grants
6. **Industry:** apparel, food-beverage, ict, consulting, retail, etc.

**Matching Strategy:**

- Match 3+ dimensions → High relevance
- Match 1-2 dimensions → Moderate relevance
- Use semantic search within filtered set for specific canvas sections
- Note: The Stage dimension will not match for venture examples because examples will be ventures at scale stage and users' ventures will be at idea or early stage

**User Queries:**

- "How do product-based social enterprises work?" → Filter by `product-sales` + `product-service-impact`
- "Examples of employment-focused ventures" → Filter by `employment` impact area

### For Human Maintainers

**Curation Strategy:**

- **Select Diverse Examples:** Include ventures across different sectors, impact areas, and business models
- **Ensure Quality:** Examples should have complete, well-written canvases and impact models
- **Comprehensive Tagging:** Tag with all relevant Selection Matrix dimensions for effective filtering
- **Keep Updated:** Review examples periodically to ensure they remain relevant and accurate
- **Balance Coverage:** Ensure representation across stages, legal structures, and funding types

**Adding New Examples:**

- Create venture folder with 3 files: {venture}-slc.md, {venture}-impact-model.md, {venture}-report.md
- Use comprehensive frontmatter tagging (impact area, mechanism, legal, revenue, funding, industry, SDGs)
- Write 1-2 sentence summary highlighting unique business model aspects
- Update core-venture-example-library.md index file
- Ensure example demonstrates clear application of SLC framework
