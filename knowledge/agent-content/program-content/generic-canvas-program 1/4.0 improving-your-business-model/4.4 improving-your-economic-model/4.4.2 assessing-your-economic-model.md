# Assessing your Economic Model 
## Assess Job Number One: Positive Unit Economics

Let's start with the first job - producing positive unit economics.

As your venture evolves, your revenue and costs sections start to form your financial model. 

`[MAIN PANEL: Economic Model section - highlight Revenue and Costs]`

Unit economics involves figuring out that on every sale of a product or service you make, you earn more money in revenue than it costs you to deliver that product or service.

This is called positive (or negative) gross margin.

Here's a simple example. Say you sell boxes of apples.

For every box of apples you sell for ten dollars, it costs you eight dollars to pick the apples, buy the box for the apples, pack them in the box and deliver the box to the shop. These are your costs of goods sold - COGS.

This gives you a positive gross margin of two dollars per box. Or a twenty percent gross margin. This is positive unit economics.

`[VISUAL TEXT: $10 revenue | $8 COGS | $2 gross margin (20%)]`

### Understanding What "Unit" Means

Now, in this example, one box of apples is the unit. But depending on the type of business you are, you'll calculate your unit economics differently.

An airline will treat each seat sold as one sale. One unit.

A car dealer will look at one car sold.

Uber will look at one hour of ride time.

Zoom might look at one year of subscription.

Each will have a different way of calculating unit economics, but the principle is the same. How much do you earn from each unit and what do they each cost to produce?  

So think about your business model. What is your unit? What does one sale look like for you?

### Fixed Costs and Breakeven

Once you've worked out your unit economics, you need to factor in the other costs you have that don't change with every sale. These are the fixed costs you have regardless of how many boxes of apples you sell.

Things like the rent for the land the apple orchard is on. The cost of pruning all the apple trees. The rent on the packing shed where they all get put into boxes.

When you know what your gross margins are, you know your fixed costs, you can then calculate how many boxes of apples you have to sell for ten dollars before the money you make on each box covers all of your fixed costs.

This is your breakeven point. Before this, you're losing money. After this, you're in profit.

`[MAIN PANEL: Simple breakeven graph showing fixed costs line and cumulative gross margin line intersecting]`

Being able to calculate this will help you understand the scaling dynamics of your business model. How big does your venture need to become before your gross margins are enough to cover the fixed costs of the business and you become sustainable?

### Assess Your Unit Economics

So look at your financial model and make sure that there is at least good potential for positive unit economics.

If you're showing negative gross margins - if your revenue per unit is less than your cost to deliver that unit - you have a fundamental problem that needs fixing now.

## Assess Job Number Two: Can You Grow?

Now let's look at the second job. Can your business model grow?

Your economic model also needs to show that you can grow. It's one thing to have a model that looks profitable on paper. But if you can't attract enough customers to get past breakeven, then it doesn't matter how good your unit economics are.


### You don't have to be huge

This is not to say that your venture has to scale to become a huge enterprise. Sometimes small is the right size.

But scale matters for financial sustainability. Looking at your unit economics will start to give you a sense of how big your business model needs to get for you to reach financial sustainability - where revenues are coving COGS and Fixed Costs


### Margins Matter

Here's a rule of thumb. Low-margin businesses like supermarkets and online retailers need significant scale to make the economics work. Whereas high-margin businesses, like luxury goods, can sustain a business model at much smaller scale.

A good example of this is the beer industry. Twenty years ago, most beer was mass-produced, high-scale, low-margin beer. In this world there were a small number of very big beer producing companies. 

Then the emergence of craft beer allowed boutique brewers to break even at much smaller scales. Why? Because craft beer - following the artisanal food trend - shifted part of the beer market from low-margin mass production to a high-end and higher-margin business. Rather than making 50cents each on a million bottles of beer, a smaller brewer could now breakeven making $3 on 50,000 bottles of beer.  

`[VISUAL TEXT: high scale/low margin → small scale/high margin]`

So if you can create premium positioning for your venture, you might not need massive scale to become sustainable.

### Is Your Market Big Enough?

We covered market size in the section on customer model, where we looked at TAM times ARPU.

That calculation - Total Addressable Market times Annual Revenue Per User - gives you your revenue potential.

The question now is: does this match your breakeven requirements?

If your TAM times ARPU doesn't get you past breakeven, you have a problem you need to fix. Either find a larger customer segment or figure out how to charge them more money. 

`[VISUAL TEXT: TAM × ARPU ≥ breakeven?]`

### Can You Reach Enough Customers?

Now, your TAM might be big enough, but can your channels reach enough of these customers?

Often ventures can have easy access to early adopters through existing relationships and other low-cost channels. But this all changes when you try to scale to your broader market.

The critical question is: Do you understand what needs to be validated in your channels?

Talk to advisors who understand the channels you're planning to use. Consult AI research tools to map out how effective you think your channel or channels will be and how much they will cost.

You're not validating yet - validation is your next step. But you need to understand what you'll need to validate.

`[MAIN PANEL: Highlight Channels section]`

### Which Channels Need to Scale?

Depending on the different customer types you have, some channels will need to scale and some won't.

For example, if you have one customer who is both the user and the payer, then you'll need one or more channels that will deliver all of your customers. These channels need to be scalable and repeatable.

However, if you have say, a user customer type as well as a payer, and the payer is a single large government agency, then you'll need a scalable channel to reach your users. But not to reach the government agency.

That might just be a one-off sales effort and the ongoing maintenance of the relationship with the government agency. That one doesn't need to be scalable and repeatable. 

### Pirate Metrics - Mapping Customer Acquisition Flow

For your scalable channels, you can lay out the customer acquisition flow and start to understand whether it can provide you the customers you need to make your business model work.

Use the Pirate Metrics model to map this customer acquisition flow.

`[MAIN PANEL: Pirate metrics funnel diagram - AARRR]`

It's called Pirate Metrics because the acronym is AARRR. It stands for:

**Acquisition** - customers discover your product or service.

**Activation** - they engage with your product or service.

**Revenue** - they pay you.

**Retention** - they come back and pay you again.

**Referral** - they tell others about you, creating new acquisition.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Acquisition | Activation | Revenue | Retention | Referral]`

Using the Pirate Metrics model, you can start to make assumptions about you customer acquisition flow. 

These numbers will start as a high-level sketch, but they give you an idea of how your channels will need to perform to get your business model to work. You'll make these assumptions more accurate as you test them in validation.

### A Rich Way to Experiment

This can be a rich way to experiment with different ideas inside your business model.

For example, if your model can't afford to pay for your acquisition channel at the scale you need, then you might need to innovate on how to improve your retention rates. It might be cheaper to retain customers than to acquire new ones.  

Perhaps there's a subscription or membership model you could use that would keep customers coming back without having to acquire new customers every time.

1
00:00:00,022 --> 00:00:02,242
Let's start with the first assessment job.

2
00:00:02,482 --> 00:00:05,992
Can your economic model produce
positive unit economics?

3
00:00:06,535 --> 00:00:09,998
As your venture evolves, your
revenue and cost sections start

4
00:00:09,998 --> 00:00:11,498
to form your financial model.

5
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:13,421
Positive unit economics.

6
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:18,856
Means figuring out that on every sale
of a product or service you make, you

7
00:00:18,856 --> 00:00:23,373
earn more money in revenue than it costs
you to deliver that product or service.

8
00:00:23,747 --> 00:00:29,207
This is called positive gross margin, or
if it's negative, negative gross margin.

9
00:00:29,694 --> 00:00:31,163
Here's a simple example.

10
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:32,937
Say you sell boxes of apples.

11
00:00:33,676 --> 00:00:37,750
For every box of apples, you
sell for $10, it costs you $8.

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,794
To pick the apples, buy the box for
the apples,  Pack them in the box,

13
00:00:41,794 --> 00:00:43,384
and deliver the box to the shop.

14
00:00:43,807 --> 00:00:46,901
these are your cost of goods sold or cogs.

15
00:00:47,576 --> 00:00:53,556
This gives you a positive gross margin
of $2 per box or 20% gross margin.

16
00:00:54,392 --> 00:00:56,037
This is positive unit economics.

17
00:00:57,006 --> 00:01:01,518
Now in this example, one box of apples
is considered a unit, but depending on

18
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:05,515
the type of business you are, you'll
calculate your unit economics differently.

19
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:09,022
An airline will treat each
seat sold as a single unit.

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,442
A car dealer will look at
one car sold as a unit.

21
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,550
Uber will look at one hour of ride time.

22
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:18,494
Zoom might look at one year
of subscription as a unit.

23
00:01:18,797 --> 00:01:22,097
Each will have different ways
of calculating unit economics,

24
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:23,597
but the principle is the same.

25
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:28,173
How much do you earn from each unit and
what does each unit cost to produce?

26
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:30,277
So think about your business model.

27
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:31,612
What is your unit?

28
00:01:31,953 --> 00:01:34,012
What does one sale look like for you?

29
00:01:35,286 --> 00:01:38,904
once you've figured out your unit
economics, you need to factor in  The

30
00:01:38,904 --> 00:01:43,911
other costs that don't change with every
sale, These are the fixed costs that you

31
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:48,615
have, regardless of how many boxes of
apples you sell,  things like the rent

32
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:50,625
on the land that the apple orchard is on.

33
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:54,607
The cost of pruning all the apple
trees, the rent on the packing shed

34
00:01:54,607 --> 00:01:55,752
where they all get put into boxes.

35
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,721
When you know what your gross margins
are and you know your fixed costs,

36
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:04,591
you can calculate how many boxes
of apples you have to sell for $10

37
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:08,913
before the money you make on each
box covers all of your fixed costs.

38
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:10,887
This is your breakeven point.

39
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:12,747
Before this, you're losing money.

40
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,517
After this, you are in profit.

41
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,050
Being able to calculate this
will help you understand the

42
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,730
scaling dynamics of your business.

43
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:24,138
How big does your venture need to
become before your gross margins

44
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:27,828
are enough to cover your fixed
costs and you become sustainable?

45
00:02:28,843 --> 00:02:30,433
So look at your financial model.

46
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:34,757
And make sure that there is at least good
potential for positive unit economics.

47
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:38,809
If you're showing negative gross
margins, if your revenue per unit is

48
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:40,879
less than your cost to deliver that unit.

49
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,568
You have a fundamental
problem that needs fixing.

50
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:43,928
Now

51
00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:48,574
Now let's look at the second
job of your economic model.

52
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:50,955
Proving that your business model can grow.

53
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:54,280
Your economic model needs
to show that you can grow.

54
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:58,384
It's one thing to have a model that
looks profitable on paper, but if you

55
00:02:58,384 --> 00:03:02,404
can't attract enough customers to get
past breakeven, then it doesn't matter

56
00:03:02,404 --> 00:03:04,204
how good your unit economics are.

57
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,890
This is not to say that your venture has
to scale to become a huge enterprise.

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,775
Sometimes small is the right
size, but scale matters for

59
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,185
financial sustainability.

60
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,380
Looking at your unit economics will
start to give you a sense of how big

61
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,011
your business needs to be in order for
you to reach financial sustainability.

62
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:28,128
When revenue is covering cogs and fixed
costs,  here's a rule of thumb, low

63
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:32,898
margin businesses like supermarkets
and online retailers need significant

64
00:03:32,898 --> 00:03:35,088
scale to make their economics work.

65
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:38,910
Whereas high margin businesses
like luxury goods can sustain a

66
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,950
business model at much smaller scale.

67
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:43,876
A good example of this
is the beer industry.

68
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:48,646
20 years ago, most beer was mass
produced, high scale, low margin beer

69
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:52,519
In this world, there were a small
number of big beer producing companies.

70
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:56,652
Then the emergence of craft beer
allowed boutique breweries to

71
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:58,692
break even at much smaller scale.

72
00:03:58,842 --> 00:03:59,322
Why?

73
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:03,770
Because craft beer, following
the artisanal food trend, shifted

74
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,127
part of the beer market from low
margin mass production to a high

75
00:04:08,127 --> 00:04:09,837
end and higher margin business.

76
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:14,418
Rather than making 50 cents each on
a million bottles of beer, a smaller

77
00:04:14,418 --> 00:04:19,065
brewer could now break even making
$3 each on 50,000 bottles of beer.

78
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:23,679
so if you can create premium positioning
for your venture, you might not need

79
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,434
massive scale to become sustainable.

80
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:27,921
We covered market size.

81
00:04:27,921 --> 00:04:31,791
In the section on customer model
where we looked at TAM times arpu,

82
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,729
that calculation, total addressable
market times annual revenue per user

83
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:38,380
gives you your revenue potential.

84
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,950
The question now is, does this
match your break even requirements?

85
00:04:43,163 --> 00:04:47,104
If your TAM Times ARPU doesn't
get you past break even, You have

86
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:48,604
a problem that you need to fix.

87
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:52,221
Either find a larger customer
segment or find out how to charge

88
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:54,261
the same customer segment more money.

89
00:04:55,803 --> 00:04:58,664
Now, your TAM might be big
enough, but can your channels

90
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:00,284
reach enough of these customers?

91
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,030
Often ventures can easily access
early adopters through existing

92
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,570
relationships and other low cost channels.

93
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,163
but there's all changes when you
try to scale to your broader market.

94
00:05:10,605 --> 00:05:13,485
do you understand what needs to
be validated in your channels?

95
00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:17,748
Talk to advisors who understand the
channels that you're planning to use.

96
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:21,499
Consult AI research tools to map
out how effective your channels

97
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:23,239
will be and how much they will cost.

98
00:05:24,028 --> 00:05:25,318
You are not validating yet.

99
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:28,453
Validation is your next step,
but you need to understand

100
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,713
what you'll need to validate.

101
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:33,314
Depending on the different customer
types you have, some channels

102
00:05:33,314 --> 00:05:34,964
will need to scale and some won't.

103
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:39,889
For example, if you have one customer
who is both the user and the payer.

104
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:44,097
Then you'll need one or more channels
that will deliver all of your customers.

105
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:47,016
These channels will need to
be scalable and repeatable.

106
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:52,119
however, if you have, say, a user,
customer type as well as a payer,

107
00:05:52,356 --> 00:05:56,009
and the payer is a single large
government agency, then you'll need a

108
00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:00,228
scalable channel to reach the user but
not to reach the government agency.

109
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,180
that might just be a one-off sales
effort and the ongoing maintenance of the

110
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,135
relationship with the government agency.

111
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,445
That one doesn't need to
be scalable and repeatable.

112
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:13,064
For your scalable channels,  you can
lay out the customer acquisition flow

113
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,520
and start to understand whether it
can provide you the customers that you

114
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,260
need to make your business model work.

115
00:06:18,565 --> 00:06:22,345
Use the Pirate metrics model to
map this customer acquisition flow.

116
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:28,595
it's called the Pirate Metrics because
the acronym is A-A-R-R-R-R, and it stands

117
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:33,290
for Acquisition   customers discover
your product or service activation.

118
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,313
They engage with your product or
service revenue, they pay you retention.

119
00:06:38,553 --> 00:06:39,980
They come back and pay you again.

120
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:41,275
Referral.

121
00:06:41,395 --> 00:06:43,989
They tell others about you
creating new acquisition.

122
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,740
Using the pirate metrics model, you
can start to make assumptions about

123
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,240
your customer acquisition flow.

124
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:55,015
These numbers will start as a high level
sketch, but they give you an idea of

125
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:58,852
how your channels will need to perform
to get your business model to work.

126
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:02,793
You'll make these assumptions more
accurate as you test them in validation.

127
00:07:03,313 --> 00:07:06,373
This can be a rich way to
experiment with different ideas

128
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:07,663
inside your business model.

129
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,036
for example,  If your model can't
afford to pay for your acquisition

130
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:14,238
channel at the scale you need, Then
you might need to innovate on how

131
00:07:14,238 --> 00:07:15,888
to improve your retention rates.

132
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:19,251
It might be cheaper to retain
customers than to acquire new ones.

133
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,369
Perhaps there's a subscription or
membership model that you could

134
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:25,944
use that would keep customers
coming back without you having to

135
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:27,864
acquire new customers every time.
