## Section 5: Conclusion

**Tag line: "Your business model, ready to test"**

### What You've Accomplished

You have just completed an important piece of work. Assessing and improving your customer, impact and economic models and having them integrated into a complete Social Lean Canvas model gives you a solid foundation upon which to validate.

### What You Know Now

Let's recap what you should know at this point.

For your **Customer Model**, you can clearly articulate your beachhead customer segment. You know your TAM times ARPU and whether it's enough. You understand the flow from customer segment to job to be done to unique value proposition to solution. You can see the path to product-market fit.

For your **Impact Model**, you have a clear causal chain from activities through outcomes to impact. You've tested the logic with experts and people with lived experience. And you understand the larger system you're operating in and where the most efficient intervention points are.

For your **Economic Model**, you can demonstrate positive unit economics, even if it's still just approximate. You know your breakeven point and the path to get there. You understand what needs to be validated in your channels to reach enough customers. And you've identified at least one form of leverage in your model.

And you've documented your core assumptions for each model. You know what you need to validate.



### Stage-Appropriate Depth

Now, all ventures are different. And all stages are different.

If you're at Idea stage, you don't need massive amounts of detail in your canvas to move forward. You're not expected to have everything figured out.

But you do need to be beyond back-of-napkin thinking.

`[VISUAL TEXT: beyond back-of-napkin | confident enough to start]`

The standard is this: Are you confident enough to start?

Not "Is this perfect?" But "Is this good enough to test?"

Not "Do I have all the answers?" But "Do I understand what needs to be validated?"

If you can answer yes to those questions, you're ready.

If you're at a later stage or have been through this improvement/validation loop several times already, you will need more detail because you will have a more refined understanding of your business model and the things you need to test next.

The goal is appropriate depth for where you are. Good enough to take the next step, whatever that next step is for you.

### Multiple Canvases

And if you've discovered multiple promising directions while improving your business model - that's good.

Having two or three alternative canvases to explore is smart. It means you've done the work to identify real opportunities.

Your strategy phase will help you prioritize which to validate first. Or you might validate multiple in parallel if your resources allow.

The point is: you have options, and they're all grounded in solid thinking.

### From Model to Action - And Back Again

You now have one or more business models worth testing. Next, you'll turn this into a clear, coherent strategy.

Strategy is how you validate your assumptions and move forward. It's how you turn your business model into action.


Time to test your model in the real world.
