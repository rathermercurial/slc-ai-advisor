# P2P Program Content

Educational modules for the Pivot-to-Purpose (P2P) program, designed specifically for solo founders and small teams. This content contextualizes the universal Social Lean Canvas methodology for one-person and micro-team entrepreneurship. It is designed to guide a user through the process of first filling in their Social Lean Canvas, then Improving their business model (by improving their Canvas) and then guide them through developing a strategy to validate and build their venture.

## Overview

This directory contains ~26 markdown files using the **"sandwich approach"** - P2P framing → Core content references → P2P commentary. Content spans a single continuous program (Modules 2.0-5.8) integrating canvas creation, improvement, and strategy development.

**Pedagogical Approach:** Video-guided instruction with P2P-specific context wrapped around universal SLC framework, emphasizing simplicity, solo-viability, and AI-augmentation.

## The Sandwich Approach Explained

### Content Pattern

Each P2P module follows this structure:

1. **P2P FRAMING** - Opens with solo/small-team context
2. **[INSERT CORE CONTENT: Topic]** - References Generic program content
3. **P2P COMMENTARY** - Closes with practical P2P application

### Example: Module 3.2.2 Customer Model

**P2P Framing (from 3.2.2 customer-model.md):**

```
Next you are going to work through the Core content on the Customer Model.
This is where you map out how you create value for customers—the foundation
of your business model.

The Core Framework walks through four key sections: Customers, Jobs to be
Done, Unique Value Proposition, and Solution...

The Core content uses the term "social enterprise" broadly—this includes
P2P ventures like yours.

After you've gone through the framework core, we'll come back and talk
about what matters most for P2P ventures specifically.
```

**Core Content Directive:**

```
[INSERT CORE CONTENT: Customer Model]
```

_This references `generic/content/3.2.2 customer-model.md`_

**P2P Commentary:**

```
## P2P COMMENTARY

### Mindset: 1,000 True Fans
First, a mindset shift. Small can be better...
Kevin Kelly's concept of "1,000 True Fans" gives us a useful lens here.

### Building a Machine
Remember, you're building a machine. Not just selling your time...

### Beware Complexity: Customer Types Matter
More customer types means multiplied work. Each customer type has its own
jobs to be done, its own value proposition. You have to validate each one
separately.

Let's look at two examples from the library to understand this better.
- Plausible Analytics keeps it simple. Single customer type...
- Ridwell is more complex. They have 2 customer types...

### P2P Constraints on Segment Selection
Channel constraints. A solo founder will find it hard to do high-touch
enterprise sales calls...

### AI Enables Solo Operation
Modern AI and digital tools make solo customer models viable in ways they
weren't five years ago...
```

### Why This Matters

**For the AI Advisor:**

- When serving P2P users, always include both P2P framing AND Core content
- P2P framing sets context and mindset
- Core content teaches universal framework
- P2P commentary provides tactical application
- Never serve Core content alone to P2P users - always add P2P context

**For Learning:**

- Solo founders get same rigorous framework as larger ventures
- P2P-specific constraints and opportunities are highlighted
- Examples from P2P library illustrate solo-viable patterns
- Avoids "one size fits all" while maintaining framework consistency

## Module Structure

### Module 2.0 - Introduction

**Learning Objective:** Orient solo founders to P2P program and opportunity.

**Content:**

## Using This README

### For the AI Advisor

**Serving P2P Content:**

1. **Identify P2P users** by keywords: solo, one-person, small team, bootstrapped, lifestyle business
2. **Always use sandwich pattern:**
   - Start with P2P framing from `p2p/content/`
   - Include Core framework from `generic/content/`
   - Close with P2P commentary from `p2p/content/`
3. **Reference P2P examples** first (from `p2p/examples/`)
4. **Emphasize P2P themes:**
   - 1,000 True Fans (small viable audiences)
   - Simplicity over complexity
   - Solo-viable constraints
   - AI and tool augmentation
   - Purpose as advantage

**Finding Content:**

- **By module number:** Same as Generic (3.2.2, 4.2, 5.4)
- **By canvas section:** Use tags (customer-model, impact-model, economic-model)
- **By user need:**
  - "How do I fill in my canvas as a solo founder?" → 3.2.X (with P2P context)
  - "Is my customer model too complex for solo?" → 3.2.2 P2P commentary + 4.2
  - "How do I validate with limited resources?" → 5.3-5.6

**Core Content References:**

- When you see `[INSERT CORE CONTENT: Topic]` in P2P files
- Fetch corresponding content from `generic/content/`
- Combine with P2P framing and commentary
- Never serve Core alone to P2P users

**Module Mapping:**
| P2P Module | Generic Equivalent | Notes |
|------------|-------------------|-------|
| 2.0 | 2.0 | P2P is unique introduction |
| 3.1 | 3.1 | Sandwich pattern applies |
| 3.2.X | 3.2.X | Sandwich pattern per section |
| 4.X | 4.X | P2P is flat, Generic is nested |
| 5.X | 5.X | P2P has more granular breakdown (5.0-5.8) |

### For Human Maintainers

**Updating P2P Content:**

- Edit P2P framing/commentary in `p2p/content/`
- Edit Core concepts in `generic/content/` (benefits both programs)
- Maintain clear Core content directives
- Keep P2P commentary practical and tactical

**Adding New Modules:**

- Determine if content should be P2P-specific or sandwich pattern
- If sandwich: Write P2P framing, add Core directive, write P2P commentary
- If P2P-only: Write full content (like 2.0 intro)
- Update this README with new modules

**Sandwich Pattern Best Practices:**

- **P2P Framing:** Set context, explain why it matters for solo founders, preview Core content
- **Core Directive:** Use format `[INSERT CORE CONTENT: Exact Topic Name]`
- **P2P Commentary:** Provide tactical application, P2P examples, tool mentions, solo constraints

**Maintaining Consistency:**

- Keep P2P themes consistent: 1,000 True Fans, simplicity, solo-viability, AI tools
- Reference P2P examples (Plausible, Ridwell, Buy Me Once, etc.)
- Emphasize async, content-driven channels
- Question complexity at every step

## Known Issues

**Filename Errors:**

- `3.2.2. customer-model.md` - Extra period after module number (should be `3.2.2 customer-model.md`)
- `4.3 improving-you-impact-model.md` - "you" instead of "your" (should be `improving-your-impact-model.md`)

**Structural Inconsistencies:**

- Module 4.0 is flat (single files) while Generic nests deeper - intentional simplification or oversight?
- Module 5.0 has 8 sub-modules vs. Generic's different structure - more granular breakdown for P2P

**Content Completion:**

- Some modules may have placeholder `[INSERT CORE CONTENT: ...]` directives without full P2P framing/commentary
- Check for balance: strong P2P framing AND commentary, not just directive
