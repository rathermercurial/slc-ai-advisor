### Introduction

Before we jump into filling in the Social Lean Canvas, let's get a couple of business model basics straight. If you can understand the essentials - what a business model is, how the different parts work together, and how we map the journey from startup idea to successful venture - the whole process will run smoother and make more sense.

If you don't understand these fundamentals, you risk investing time, energy, and capital in the wrong places and burning your opportunity to make venture idea work.

This section is about those basics so we share the same mental model before we touch the canvas. Once that's in place, each step we take becomes clear, testable, and faster to execute.

### What Is a Business Model?

Let's start by looking at what a business model actually is.

People often define the term "business model" in different ways, which adds to the confusion. Some people point to the business model as being only the financial side of a venture. But this misses seeing your venture as an integrated system that needs to function as a whole.

We need to see the business model as the core machine that drives the whole business or social enterprise, more than just the money side.

This might sound complex, but in reality there are just four fundamental pieces. To have a business model, you have to create value, deliver value, capture value, and manage costs. If you can do that, you have a business model.

Let's look at a quick example: a coffee cart. You sell great coffee - that's creating value. You're at a train station where commuters pass by on their way to work - that's delivering value. You charge 5 dollars cash or card for a cup of coffee - that's capturing value. You watch the price of beans, staff hours, and permit fees - that's managing costs.

For purpose-driven ventures, we add one more dimension: creating impact. You still create, deliver, and capture value while managing your costs. But you also aim to create measurable change in the world, not just satisfied customers.

If we map this simple business model definition to the Social Lean Canvas - we have  the Customer Model - how you create value - who you serve, the job they need done, the promise they'll respond to, and the solution you'll deliver.

The Impact Model - how you create impact - from the issue you care about, your activities and the outcomes you'll generate, through to the ultimate impact you're aiming for.

And the Economic Model - the business model's engine: you deliver value through Channels, capture value through Revenue, and manage costs in your Costs section. Advantage captures the leverage that makes your model powerful.

This is an integrated view of how your business model works. It allows you to see and understand the important interactions across your venture that will need to happen to make it work.

### Why Design a Business Model?

So why should we bother designing our business model? Why not just take our idea and start executing it?

From the outside, business models can look simple - you make something, you sell something. But in reality, there are hundreds of decisions that shape a business model. Each one nudges you toward success or failure.

`[MAIN PANEL: Business model complexity visualization]`

Think about that coffee cart example. Looks simple, right? But underneath, there are dozens of choices.... Which station do you set up at? What hours do you operate? What coffee beans? What level of quality? What price point? Do you take card payments or cash? Do you offer food? What's your customer service approach? How do you handle bad weather? Each decision affects whether the cart succeeds or fails.

Now multiply that complexity for a full sized venture. Where do you find customers? How do you reach them? What value proposition resonates? What's the right solution? How do you deliver it? What should you charge? What partnerships do you need?

For purpose-driven ventures, this complexity is amplified. You need to integrate an impact model into an already complex business model. You're juggling customer value creation and impact delivery simultaneously.

If we don't use a systematic process to design our business model, we're just guessing. And guessing is a recipe for burnout, failure, and wasted potential.

Design beats guesswork.
