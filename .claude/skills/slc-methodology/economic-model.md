# Economic Model

The Economic Model defines how you sustain your venture financially. It contains 4 sections that answer the question: "How do we survive?"

## Sections

### 1. Channels

**Question:** How do you reach customers?

**Types:**
- **Awareness channels:** How customers learn about you (social media, PR, word of mouth)
- **Acquisition channels:** How customers sign up/purchase (website, app store, sales team)
- **Delivery channels:** How you deliver value (in-person, digital, mail)

**Consider:**
- Direct vs indirect (partners, resellers)
- Online vs offline
- Owned vs paid vs earned

### 2. Revenue

**Question:** How do you make money?

**Revenue models for social ventures:**
| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Earned revenue | Selling products/services |
| Grants | Foundation/government funding |
| Donations | Individual/corporate giving |
| Membership/subscription | Recurring fees |
| Fee-for-service | Per-transaction payment |
| Cross-subsidy | Paying customers subsidize beneficiaries |
| Hybrid | Multiple revenue streams |

**Key metrics:**
- Revenue per customer
- Customer lifetime value
- Revenue mix (% earned vs donated)

### 3. Costs

**Question:** What are your major expenses?

**Categories:**
- **Fixed costs:** Don't change with volume (rent, salaries, software subscriptions)
- **Variable costs:** Scale with volume (materials, transaction fees, delivery)
- **One-time costs:** Setup expenses (equipment, development)

**For social ventures, also consider:**
- Program delivery costs
- Fundraising costs
- Compliance/reporting costs

**Cost structure types:**
- Cost-driven (minimize costs, commodity pricing)
- Value-driven (premium experience, higher costs acceptable)

### 4. Advantage

**Question:** What makes you hard to copy?

Also called "Unfair Advantage" or "Moat."

**Types of advantages:**
| Advantage | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Network effects | More users = more value (marketplaces) |
| Community/brand | Strong emotional connection |
| Proprietary data | Unique dataset from operations |
| Expertise/team | Specialized knowledge or relationships |
| Regulatory/legal | Licenses, certifications, patents |
| Cost structure | Economies of scale, unique supply chain |
| Switching costs | High cost for customers to leave |

**For social ventures:**
- Deep community trust
- Beneficiary relationships
- Impact measurement expertise
- Mission-aligned team

**Warning:** "Passion" and "first mover" are NOT sustainable advantages.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Ignoring the business model** - Even nonprofits need sustainable economics
2. **Single revenue stream** - Diversification reduces risk
3. **Underestimating costs** - Include hidden costs (time, overhead, fundraising)
4. **Weak advantage** - "We care more" isn't defensible; find structural advantages
