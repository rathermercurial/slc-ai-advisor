## Section 5.7: Building Your Strategy Model

**Tag line: "From validation to execution"**

### Bringing It All Together

You've done the hard work. You've created validation plans for your customer model, your impact model, and your economic model. You know what assumptions need testing and how you'll test them.

Now you need to bring all of this together into one coherent strategy that you can actually execute.

`[MAIN PANEL: The three validation plans side by side]`

That's what a strategy model does. It takes your validation plans and turns them into an execution roadmap. It shows what happens when, in what order, and what you need to make it possible.


### What Is a Strategy Model?

Your strategy model has three layers that work together.

`[MAIN PANEL: Strategy model template showing three layers]`

**The Business Model Layer** - Your validation experiments and execution activities. This is what you're doing to test and build your business model. Your validation plans from the last three sections become this layer.

**The Organizational Layer** - What needs to happen organizationally to make your business model strategy possible. Team, structure, partnerships, assets.

**The Capital Layer** - Where funding enters to enable your organizational and business model strategies. When you need it, how much, from whom.

These three layers interact and influence each other. They're not built separately - they work as a system. 
 

And they're laid out across a timeline: two months, six months, eighteen months.

### The 2/6/18 Month Timeline

This timeline structure gives you the right balance between planning and flexibility.

**Two months** - This is your detailed, committed plan. You know exactly what you're doing, who's doing it, what resources you need. This is tight and specific.

**Six months** - This is your likely next steps if your two-month experiments go according to plan. Still specific enough to be useful, but with the knowledge that you'll learn things in the first two months that might change this.

**Eighteen months** - This is your longer arc. Where you're heading if things continue to progress. You know this will change, but it gives you direction and helps you see inflection points.

`[VISUAL TEXT: 2 months = detailed plan | 6 months = likely next steps | 18 months = longer arc]`

This structure lets you be thoughtful and strategic while staying flexible and adaptive to new learning.

As you move from idea and early stage through to growth and scale stages you will stretch out your timeline to reflect the longer-term planning that you need to do as you transition from experimentation to execution. But the 2. 6. and 18 month model is an ideal balance of structure and flexibility for early stage ventures.

### Step 1: Building Your Business Model Layer

Start with your validation plans from sections 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6.

`[MAIN PANEL: Validation plans ready to map onto timeline]`

These experiments and activities become your business model layer. You're mapping them onto the timeline and sequencing them logically.

Some experiments need to happen before others. Customer discovery before quantitative testing. Impact model research before running pilots. Certain economic assumptions can only be tested after customer assumptions are validated.

Work through this sequencing. What must come first? What can happen in parallel? What are the dependencies?

Let's see what this might have looked like for Toast Ale.

### Toast Ale: Business Model Layer

The founders take their validation plans and map them across the timeline.

`[MAIN PANEL: Toast Ale business model layer on strategy model template]`

**0-2 Months: Customer Discovery and Impact Research**

The first two months are all about discovery. They're running twenty to thirty customer interviews with craft beer enthusiasts to understand their jobs to be done and test different value propositions. At the same time, they're having ten conversations with bakeries about surplus bread - understanding volumes, logistics, and willingness to partner.

They're brewing small homebrew batches for taste tests. Testing different positioning approaches. Does "beer made from surplus bread" work better than "fighting food waste one beer at a time"? They're learning the language that resonates.

On the impact side, they're doing research. What does the literature say about food waste's environmental impact? What are the emissions from bread waste in landfills? How much bread waste exists in their city? They're also talking to environmental charities about potential partnership models.

These are mostly qualitative, exploratory activities. Low cost, high learning. This is pure discovery.

**2-6 Months: Quantitative Testing**

Once they've completed Customer Discovery and understand what resonates, they move to proof at scale. They brew a larger batch - five hundred bottles. This isn't homebrew anymore - they're partnering with a local brewery to produce at commercial quality.

They place the beer in ten bottle shops across the city. Now they're measuring real numbers. What's the shelf-to-purchase conversion rate? What does it actually cost to acquire a customer through this channel? Does the five dollar price point hold up when people encounter it in a retail environment? Are people coming back for more?

On the impact side, they're formalizing partnerships with three bakeries. They're collecting bread for three months and measuring actual diversion. How much bread are they really diverting from landfill? What are the logistics costs? They're piloting the charity funding mechanism - do the economics allow them to donate meaningful amounts?

This phase is about proving that the insights from discovery hold up with real numbers.

**6-18 Months: Scale and Formalize**

If the pilot proves the model works - if conversion rates are strong, if unit economics are positive, if impact is measurable - then they're ready to scale.

They move to producing five thousand bottles per month. They expand distribution to fifty bottle shops. They're building a real brand now, using the sustainability story to drive awareness. They formalize bakery partnerships with actual contracts. They establish a regular rhythm of charity funding based on profits.

This is the transition from validation to execution. They're not just testing anymore - they're building a business.

`[VISUAL TEXT: 0-2 = discovery | 2-6 = proof at scale | 6-18 = scale & formalize]`

This is their business model layer. It shows what they're validating and building, when, and in what order.

### Step 2: Building Your Organizational Layer

Now ask: What organizational pieces need to be in place to execute this business model strategy?

For each phase of your timeline, think through:

**People** - Who needs to be involved? Part-time or full-time? What roles?

**Structure** - Legal entity? Governance? Formal incorporation?

**Partnerships** - What relationships need to be established? When?

**Assets and infrastructure** - Physical space? Equipment? Systems?

The organizational layer enables the business model layer. It's what needs to exist for your strategy to be executable.

### Toast Ale: Organizational Layer

The founders map their organizational needs across the timeline.

`[MAIN PANEL: Toast Ale organizational layer added below business model layer]`

**0-2 Months: Minimal Structure**

In the first two months, they keep it lean. Both founders are working part-time - nights and weekends while keeping their day jobs. They don't have a formal legal structure yet because they're not selling anything. They're brewing homebrew batches in one founder's kitchen. Their relationships with bakeries and bottle shops are informal - just conversations, building rapport.

This minimal structure works for customer discovery and research. They don't need more.

**2-6 Months: Building Capacity**

The pilot requires more structure. They bring in a brewing partner - a friend with commercial brewing experience who can help produce the five hundred bottle batch. He's working part-time too, but his expertise is critical.

They establish a legal entity now - probably an LLC or similar structure - because they're selling product and need legal protection. They formalize their bakery partnerships with actual contracts specifying bread collection schedules and logistics. They rent commercial brewing space for the pilot batch - they can't make five hundred bottles in a home kitchen.

One founder transitions to working three days a week on Toast Ale. The business is demanding more time.

The organizational layer is growing to match the business model demands.

**6-18 Months: Professional Operation**

To scale, they need professional capacity. One founder goes full-time - this is now their primary job. They hire their first employee focused on operations and logistics - someone to manage the growing complexity of bread collection, production coordination, and distribution.

They establish an ongoing partnership with a production brewery who has capacity they can rent. They're not buying their own equipment yet - that's too capital intensive - but they have reliable production capability.

They create formal governance - maybe a board of advisors or directors to provide oversight and guidance. And they build systems for tracking everything - sales, waste diversion, charity funding. They need data infrastructure now.

This is what a professional operation looks like. It's no longer a side project.

`[VISUAL TEXT: 0-2 = minimal | 2-6 = building capacity | 6-18 = professional operation]`

Notice how the organizational layer matches the business model layer. Each phase of validation and execution requires appropriate organizational support.

### Step 3: Building Your Capital Layer

Now the question is: Where does funding enter to make your organizational and business model strategies possible? You need to develop your Capital Strategy. 

Look at your first two layers and identify where you need capital to enable them.

**Inflection points** - These are moments when your business model validation creates a state change that makes you fundable. You've removed a big risk or proven something significant. This is when investors or funders can see your potential and are willing to put capital in.

Different capital sources make sense at different times:

**Bootstrap** - Your own savings, early revenue. Common at idea stage.

**Grants** - From foundations or government programs. Often good for impact-focused ventures.

**Friends and Family** - Small amounts from people who believe in you.

**Investors** - Larger amounts requiring equity or other terms. Usually need proof before they'll engage.

Identify your inflection points. Plan your capital strategy around them.

### Toast Ale: Capital Layer

The founders map where capital needs to enter.

`[MAIN PANEL: Toast Ale capital layer added below organizational layer, showing complete three-layer strategy]`

**0-2 Months: Bootstrap**

The first two months require about five thousand dollars. The founders cover this from personal savings. It pays for homebrew materials, travel to customer interviews and bakery visits, maybe some simple website hosting. The burn rate is minimal because both founders are still employed and working part-time.

No external capital needed yet. They're too early - no proof of concept. No investor or funder would be interested at this stage.

**6 Month Inflection Point: Pilot Results**

But if the two to six month pilot proves the model works - if conversion rates are good, if costs are manageable, if impact is measurable - something changes. They've created an inflection point.

Now they have proof. They can show data. Customer validation - people are buying the beer in retail environments. Economic validation - unit economics are positive at this scale. Impact validation - they're actually diverting bread from landfill and avoiding emissions.

This proof makes them fundable. Before the pilot, they had a nice idea. After the pilot, they have a validated business model. That's the difference that matters to funders and investors.

**6-18 Months: Small Round**

With that proof, they can raise about fifty thousand dollars. This might come from a small grant from an environmental foundation who likes their impact model. Or it might be a friends and family round - people who know the founders and believe in what they're building.

This capital enables the scale-up. They use it to increase production, hire their first employee, invest in marketing to build brand awareness, and create the systems they need to operate professionally. One founder goes full-time on this capital.

Without the six-month inflection point - without that pilot proof - they couldn't raise this money. With it, they can raise what they need without giving up significant ownership or control.

`[VISUAL TEXT: 0-2 = bootstrap | 6mo = inflection point | 6-18 = $50K raise]`

Notice the strategy here. They bootstrap to proof. Proof creates fundability. Then they raise just enough to scale to the next stage. They're not trying to raise a big round too early when they'd have to give up too much equity. They're being strategic about capital.

### How the Layers Interact

Here's the critical insight: These layers aren't built independently and then stacked. They interact and influence each other.

`[MAIN PANEL: Show arrows between layers indicating interaction]`

Your business model strategy might require organizational capacity you can't afford without capital. But you might not be able to raise capital until you've proven more of your business model.

This tension forces you to rethink your strategy. Maybe you need to reorder your business model validation so you can reach a fundable inflection point sooner. Or maybe you need to find a different organizational approach that requires less capital.

For Toast Ale, imagine they'd planned to buy their own brewing equipment in month three. That would cost $200,000. They can't bootstrap that much. And they won't be fundable at three months without proof.

So they revise: Instead of buying equipment, they partner with an existing brewery who has excess capacity. This removes the capital requirement until they're much further along and can justify a larger raise.

`[VISUAL TEXT: layers interact | constraints force creativity | test scenarios]`

The strategy model lets you test these scenarios. "What if we did X instead? How would that change the organizational and capital layers? Would that be better or worse?"

This is why the strategy model is such a powerful tool. It helps you see the whole system and optimize across all three layers.

### Key Metrics: Tracking Your Progress

<span style="color:red">clap</span> 

Now let's talk about how you track progress through your strategy.

`[MAIN PANEL: Key Metrics box on canvas]`

Your key metrics correspond to what you're validating at each stage. They show whether your experiments are succeeding, whether you're learning what you need to learn, and whether you're moving forward.

### What to Track When

Early stage validation metrics are different from later stage execution metrics.

**0-2 Months: Discovery Phase**

In the discovery phase, Toast Ale tracks activity metrics. Did they complete twenty-five customer interviews? Did they engage ten bakeries in conversations? Did they run five taste test sessions? Are they documenting the key insights they're learning?

These metrics show whether they're doing the discovery work they planned. Are they generating the insights they need to move forward?

**2-6 Months: Proof Phase**

In the proof phase, the metrics shift to validation. What's the shelf-to-purchase conversion rate? They're targeting fifteen percent. What's their customer acquisition cost through bottle shops? They want it under three dollars per customer. How much bread are they collecting from bakeries? They're targeting five hundred kilograms over three months. What emissions are they avoiding based on the bread they've diverted?

These metrics prove whether their assumptions hold up at scale. They're not tracking activities anymore - they're tracking whether the model works.

**6-18 Months: Scale Phase**

In the scale phase, metrics become more about execution. What's their monthly production volume and revenue? What's their gross margin per bottle - they need forty percent or better to make the economics work. What's the customer retention rate - are thirty percent of customers repurchasing within three months? What's their cumulative environmental impact - total bread diverted, total emissions avoided?

These are business performance metrics now. They're measuring whether the business model is working at scale.

`[VISUAL TEXT: early = activities | mid = validation | later = execution]`

Your metrics evolve as you progress through your strategy. Each phase needs different measurements because you're answering different questions.

### Ratios vs Hard Numbers

Use ratios, not just hard numbers, because ratios give you scalable insights.

**Hard number:** "We sold 500 bottles" - Okay, but what does that mean?

**Ratio:** "15% shelf-to-purchase conversion rate" - Now you can predict what happens when you're in 50 shops instead of 10.

**Hard number:** "We got 25 referrals" - Is that good?

**Ratio:** "10% referral rate from paying customers" - Now you know: for every 100 customers, you get 10 referrals. That's predictive power.

Toast Ale might use ratios throughout:

- Conversion rate (activation to purchase)
- Customer acquisition cost (dollars per customer)
- Retention rate (percentage who repurchase)
- Bread diversion efficiency (kg collected per bakery per week)

These ratios let them model what happens at scale.

### Avoiding Vanity Metrics

Vanity metrics feel good but don't show learning. They make you feel like you're making progress when you might not be.

**Vanity:** "Total bottles sold" - Could be driven by you buying your own product or friends pity-buying.

**Real:** "Conversion rate from retail shelf to purchase" - Shows actual customer demand.

**Vanity:** "Total social media followers" - Means nothing if they don't buy.

**Real:** "Customer acquisition cost through social media" - Shows if social media is an effective channel.

**Vanity:** "Total bread collected" - Sounds impressive but doesn't show efficiency.

**Real:** "Cost per kilogram of bread diverted" - Shows if the impact model economics work.

`[VISUAL TEXT: vanity = feels good | real = proves assumptions]`

Choose metrics that prove or disprove your assumptions. That's what moves you forward.

### Your Strategy Model as a Living Document

Your strategy model is not something you create once and never touch again. It's a living document that evolves as you learn.

Set regular review cycles. Maybe monthly in your early stages when things are changing fast. Quarterly once you're in execution mode.

In each review, ask:

What did we learn from our validation experiments?

What assumptions were proven? What were disproven?

Does our strategy need to change based on what we learned?

`[MAIN PANEL: Strategy review cycle diagram]`

When validation invalidates assumptions - and it will - revise your strategy.

For Toast Ale, imagine after two months of customer discovery they learned that bottle shops aren't actually the right channel. Craft beer drinkers who care about sustainability shop mostly online and at farmers markets.

This invalidates their 2-6 month plan. The bottle shop pilot won't work.

So they revise: Instead of bottle shops, they plan an online sales pilot and farmers market presence. This changes their organizational layer (need e-commerce capability, not retail relationships). Might change their capital layer (different infrastructure costs).

`[VISUAL TEXT: learn → revise → execute → learn]`

The strategy model makes this revision process clean. You can see the ripple effects across all three layers and adjust accordingly.

This is how you navigate uncertainty. Not by predicting perfectly, but by planning flexibly and revising as you learn.

### Stage-Appropriate Strategy

Your strategy will look different depending on what stage you're at.

`[MAIN PANEL: Venture Stage Map reference]`

**Idea Stage** - Mostly experiments, minimal organizational structure, usually bootstrapped. Your strategy is primarily about validation.

**Early Stage** - Mix of validation and execution, building organizational capacity, possibly first external capital. Your strategy balances proving and building.

**Growth Stage** - Validating that the model will work at scale, raising capital for growth if needed. Your strategy focuses on growing into a business that can succeed

**Scale Stage** - Optimizing and improving, investing in scale, professional management. Strategic partnerships. Your strategy focuses on sustained delivery of your economics and impact at scale

Toast Ale starts at idea stage across all dimensions. Their strategy reflects this - discovery-heavy early on, building toward early stage through validation.

Your strategy should match your stage. Don't try to build growth stage infrastructure when you're at idea stage. And don't stay in perpetual validation mode when you're ready to execute.

### Creating Your Strategy Model: A Working Session

This is substantial work. Don't rush it.

Set aside dedicated time - maybe a weekend - to work through this properly. If you have a team, do it together. If you have advisors, involve them in reviewing your thinking.

But remember: You hold the systems view. Advisors see through the lens of their expertise. You see how all the pieces fit together.

Use advisors for input and challenge. Don't outsource your thinking to them. This is your strategy. You need to own it.

`[VISUAL TEXT: dedicated time | involve team/advisors | you hold systems view]`


By the end, have a clear two-month plan, a solid six-month plan, and a directional eighteen-month plan. All three layers mapped and integrated.


### Ready to Move Forward

You have a complete strategy model when you can answer these questions:

Do you have a clear, detailed two-month plan?

Have you mapped a logical six-month plan based on your validation experiments succeeding?

Do you have an aspirational eighteen-month plan showing your longer arc?

Have you built all three layers - business model, organizational, and capital?

Do the layers work together, with each enabling the others?

Have you identified your key metrics for tracking progress at each stage?

`[VISUAL TEXT: 2/6/18 plans clear | three layers integrated | metrics defined]`

If yes, you have a strategy. You know what you're doing next and why. You have a roadmap from where you are now to where you're heading.

Time to wrap this up and start to execute the strategy.
