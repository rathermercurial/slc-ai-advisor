### Channels

Channels are how your enterprise connects with your customers at scale. And there are two distinct components to channels. Firstly, channels through which your customer finds you and becomes your customer. These are known as customer acquisition channels or marketing channels. They could be things like online advertising, word of mouth, affiliate networks, print advertising, store frontage, things like that.

The second component of channels covers how your product or service gets to your customers. These are known as distribution channels. They could be things like a retail location, career delivery, delivery through an online platform like Amazon, physical classroom delivery, sales through a distribution partner, things like that.

Both of these things are crucial to understanding how your economic model will work at scale. You will need to be able to prove that your channels will be effective at providing what your business model needs. And also, channels usually incur significant cost. So you'll need to be able to model these costs and feed them into your financial model.
