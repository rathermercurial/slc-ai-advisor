## **1. Description**

  

**Short outline (<100 words)**

**Name:** Ness Labs.

**Founder:** Anne-Laure Le Cunff (neuroscientist; PhD, King’s College London).

**Origin:** Began in 2019 as the _Maker Mind_ newsletter and blog, translating neuroscience into practical tools; evolved into a learning community with courses, meetups, and a growing library.

**Enterprise type:** Creator-led online school + media + community.

**Purpose:** Help knowledge workers think better and work mindfully with science-backed practices.

**Existing Alternatives — Detailed Analysis (50–75 words)**

Individuals rely on mainstream productivity books, free blogs, YouTube channels, generic forums, or coaching. Numerous newsletters and communities in productivity, PKM, and creator education compete for attention. “Do nothing” means continuing ad-hoc learning without support. Sponsors can buy social ads, podcast placements, or larger media newsletters, but often at higher cost and with weaker contextual alignment to neuroscience-anchored, mindful productivity audiences.

  

**Existing Alternatives — Synopsis (<25 words)**

Books, blogs, and generic communities; coaching; larger newsletters/podcasts; paid social; or “do nothing.”

  

### **Unique Value Proposition (UVP)**

  

**UVP — Detailed Analysis (75–100 words)**

For members/readers: credible, compassionate synthesis of neuroscience and practical workflows—delivered as articles, courses, and an active community with matching and live sessions. For sponsors: a tightly defined niche of curious, tool-savvy knowledge workers with demonstrated intent and high trust in the brand’s editorial standards. Distinctive tone (anti-hustle, evidence-based) and continuity (weekly publishing since 2019) differentiate Ness Labs from generic productivity content.

  

**UVP — Synopsis (<25 words each)**

- **Members/readers:** Neuroscience-grounded, mindful productivity with courses, events, and community support.
