### Step 1: Building Your Business Model Layer

Start with your validation plans from sections 

`[MAIN PANEL: Validation plans ready to map onto timeline]`

These experiments and activities become your business model layer. You're mapping them onto the timeline and sequencing them logically.

Some experiments need to happen before others. Customer discovery before quantitative testing. Impact model research before running pilots. Certain economic assumptions can only be tested after customer assumptions are validated.

Work through this sequencing. What must come first? What can happen in parallel? What are the dependencies?

Let's see what this might have looked like for Toast Ale.

### Toast Ale: Business Model Layer

The founders take their validation plans and map them across the timeline.

**0-2 Months: Customer Discovery and Impact Research**

The first two months are all about discovery. They're running twenty to thirty customer interviews with craft beer enthusiasts to understand their jobs to be done and test different value propositions. At the same time, they're having ten conversations with bakeries about surplus bread - understanding volumes, logistics, and willingness to partner.

They're brewing small homebrew batches for taste tests. Testing different positioning approaches. Does "beer made from surplus bread" work better than "fighting food waste one beer at a time"? They're learning the language that resonates.

On the impact side, they're doing research. What does the literature say about food waste's environmental impact? What are the emissions from bread waste in landfills? How much bread waste exists in their city? They're also talking to environmental charities about potential partnership models.

These are mostly qualitative, exploratory activities. Low cost, high learning. This is pure discovery.

**2-6 Months: Quantitative Testing**

Once they've completed Customer Discovery and understand what resonates, they move to proof at scale. They brew a larger batch - five hundred bottles. This isn't homebrew anymore - they're partnering with a local brewery to produce at commercial quality.

They place the beer in ten bottle shops across the city. Now they're measuring real numbers. What's the shelf-to-purchase conversion rate? What does it actually cost to acquire a customer through this channel? Does the five dollar price point hold up when people encounter it in a retail environment? Are people coming back for more?

On the impact side, they're formalizing partnerships with three bakeries. They're collecting bread for three months and measuring actual diversion. How much bread are they really diverting from landfill? What are the logistics costs? They're piloting the charity funding mechanism - do the economics allow them to donate meaningful amounts?

This phase is about proving that the insights from discovery hold up with real numbers.

**6-18 Months: Scale and Formalize**

If the pilot proves the model works - if conversion rates are strong, if unit economics are positive, if impact is measurable - then they're ready to scale.

They move to producing five thousand bottles per month. They expand distribution to fifty bottle shops. They're building a real brand now, using the sustainability story to drive awareness. They formalize bakery partnerships with actual contracts. They establish a regular rhythm of charity funding based on profits.

This is the transition from validation to execution. They're not just testing anymore - they're building a business.

`[VISUAL TEXT: 0-2 = discovery | 2-6 = proof at scale | 6-18 = scale & formalize]`

This is their business model layer. It shows what they're validating and building, when, and in what order.

### Step 2: Building Your Organizational Layer

Now ask: What organizational pieces need to be in place to execute this business model strategy?

For each phase of your timeline, think through:

**People** - Who needs to be involved? Part-time or full-time? What roles?

**Structure** - Legal entity? Governance? Formal incorporation?

**Partnerships** - What relationships need to be established? When?

**Assets and infrastructure** - Physical space? Equipment? Systems?

The organizational layer enables the business model layer. It's what needs to exist for your strategy to be executable.

### Toast Ale: Organizational Layer

The founders map their organizational needs across the timeline.

**0-2 Months: Minimal Structure**

In the first two months, they keep it lean. Both founders are working part-time - nights and weekends while keeping their day jobs. They don't have a formal legal structure yet because they're not selling anything. They're brewing homebrew batches in one founder's kitchen. Their relationships with bakeries and bottle shops are informal - just conversations, building rapport.

This minimal structure works for customer discovery and research. They don't need more.

**2-6 Months: Building Capacity**

The pilot requires more structure. They bring in a brewing partner - a friend with commercial brewing experience who can help produce the five hundred bottle batch. He's working part-time too, but his expertise is critical.

They establish a legal entity now - probably an LLC or similar structure - because they're selling product and need legal protection. They formalize their bakery partnerships with actual contracts specifying bread collection schedules and logistics. They rent commercial brewing space for the pilot batch - they can't make five hundred bottles in a home kitchen.

One founder transitions to working three days a week on Toast Ale. The business is demanding more time.

The organizational layer is growing to match the business model demands.

**6-18 Months: Professional Operation**

To scale, they need professional capacity. One founder goes full-time - this is now their primary job. They hire their first employee focused on operations and logistics - someone to manage the growing complexity of bread collection, production coordination, and distribution.

They establish an ongoing partnership with a production brewery who has capacity they can rent. They're not buying their own equipment yet - that's too capital intensive - but they have reliable production capability.

They create formal governance - maybe a board of advisors or directors to provide oversight and guidance. And they build systems for tracking everything - sales, waste diversion, charity funding. They need data infrastructure now.

This is what a professional operation looks like. It's no longer a side project.

`[VISUAL TEXT: 0-2 = minimal | 2-6 = building capacity | 6-18 = professional operation]`

Notice how the organizational layer matches the business model layer. Each phase of validation and execution requires appropriate organizational support.

### Step 3: Building Your Capital Layer

Now the question is: Where does funding enter to make your organizational and business model strategies possible? You need to develop your Capital Strategy. 

Look at your first two layers and identify where you need capital to enable them.

**Inflection points** - These are moments when your business model validation creates a state change that makes you fundable. You've removed a big risk or proven something significant. This is when investors or funders can see your potential and are willing to put capital in.

Different capital sources make sense at different times:

**Bootstrap** - Your own savings, early revenue. Common at idea stage.

**Grants** - From foundations or government programs. Often good for impact-focused ventures.

**Friends and Family** - Small amounts from people who believe in you.

**Investors** - Larger amounts requiring equity or other terms. Usually need proof before they'll engage.

Identify your inflection points. Plan your capital strategy around them.

### Toast Ale: Capital Layer

The founders map where capital needs to enter.

**0-2 Months: Bootstrap**

The first two months require about five thousand dollars. The founders cover this from personal savings. It pays for homebrew materials, travel to customer interviews and bakery visits, maybe some simple website hosting. The burn rate is minimal because both founders are still employed and working part-time.

No external capital needed yet. They're too early - no proof of concept. No investor or funder would be interested at this stage.

**6 Month Inflection Point: Pilot Results**

But if the two to six month pilot proves the model works - if conversion rates are good, if costs are manageable, if impact is measurable - something changes. They've created an inflection point.

Now they have proof. They can show data. Customer validation - people are buying the beer in retail environments. Economic validation - unit economics are positive at this scale. Impact validation - they're actually diverting bread from landfill and avoiding emissions.

This proof makes them fundable. Before the pilot, they had a nice idea. After the pilot, they have a validated business model. That's the difference that matters to funders and investors.

**6-18 Months: Small Round**

With that proof, they can raise about fifty thousand dollars. This might come from a small grant from an environmental foundation who likes their impact model. Or it might be a friends and family round - people who know the founders and believe in what they're building.

This capital enables the scale-up. They use it to increase production, hire their first employee, invest in marketing to build brand awareness, and create the systems they need to operate professionally. One founder goes full-time on this capital.

Without the six-month inflection point - without that pilot proof - they couldn't raise this money. With it, they can raise what they need without giving up significant ownership or control.

`[VISUAL TEXT: 0-2 = bootstrap | 6mo = inflection point | 6-18 = $50K raise]`

Notice the strategy here. They bootstrap to proof. Proof creates fundability. Then they raise just enough to scale to the next stage. They're not trying to raise a big round too early when they'd have to give up too much equity. They're being strategic about capital.

### How the Layers Interact

Here's the critical insight: These layers aren't built independently and then stacked. They interact and influence each other.

`[MAIN PANEL: Show arrows between layers indicating interaction]`

Your business model strategy might require organizational capacity you can't afford without capital. But you might not be able to raise capital until you've proven more of your business model.

This tension forces you to rethink your strategy. Maybe you need to reorder your business model validation so you can reach a fundable inflection point sooner. Or maybe you need to find a different organizational approach that requires less capital.

For Toast Ale, imagine they'd planned to buy their own brewing equipment in month three. That would cost $200,000. They can't bootstrap that much. And they won't be fundable at three months without proof.

So they revise: Instead of buying equipment, they partner with an existing brewery who has excess capacity. This removes the capital requirement until they're much further along and can justify a larger raise.

`[VISUAL TEXT: layers interact | constraints force creativity | test scenarios]`

The strategy model lets you test these scenarios. "What if we did X instead? How would that change the organizational and capital layers? Would that be better or worse?"

This is why the strategy model is such a powerful tool. It helps you see the whole system and optimize across all three layers.
