### Introduction

Before we jump into filling in the Social Lean Canvas, let's get a couple of business model basics straight. If you can understand the essentials - what a business model is, how the different parts work together, and how we map the journey from startup idea to successful venture - the whole process will run smoother and make more sense.

If you don't understand these fundamentals, you risk investing time, energy, and capital in the wrong places and burning your opportunity to make venture idea work.

This section is about those basics so we share the same mental model before we touch the canvas. Once that's in place, each step we take becomes clear, testable, and faster to execute.

### What Is a Business Model?

Let's start by looking at what a business model actually is.

People often define the term "business model" in different ways, which adds to the confusion. Some people point to the business model as being only the financial side of a venture. But this misses seeing your venture as an integrated system that needs to function as a whole.

We need to see the business model as the core machine that drives the whole business or social enterprise, more than just the money side.

`[MAIN PANEL: Four-part business model diagram]`

This might sound complex, but in reality there are just four fundamental pieces. To have a business model, you have to create value, deliver value, capture value, and manage costs. If you can do that, you have a business model.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Create | Deliver | Capture | Manage]`

Let's look at a quick example: a coffee cart. You sell great coffee - that's creating value. You're at a train station where commuters pass by on their way to work - that's delivering value. You charge 5 dollars cash or card for a cup of coffee - that's capturing value. You watch the price of beans, staff hours, and permit fees - that's managing costs.

For purpose-driven ventures, we add one more dimension: creating impact. You still create, deliver, and capture value while managing your costs. But you also aim to create measurable change in the world, not just satisfied customers.

If we map this simple business model definition to the Social Lean Canvas - we have  the Customer Model - how you create value - who you serve, the job they need done, the promise they'll respond to, and the solution you'll deliver.

The Impact Model - how you create impact - from the issue you care about, your activities and the outcomes you'll generate, through to the ultimate impact you're aiming for.

And the Economic Model - the business model's engine: you deliver value through Channels, capture value through Revenue, and manage costs in your Costs section. Advantage captures the leverage that makes your model powerful.

This is an integrated view of how your business model works. It allows you to see and understand the important interactions across your venture that will need to happen to make it work.

### Why Design a Business Model?

So why should we bother designing our business model? Why not just take our idea and start executing it?

From the outside, business models can look simple - you make something, you sell something. But in reality, there are hundreds of decisions that shape a business model. Each one nudges you toward success or failure.

`[MAIN PANEL: Business model complexity visualization]`

Think about that coffee cart example. Looks simple, right? But underneath, there are dozens of choices.... Which station do you set up at? What hours do you operate? What coffee beans? What level of quality? What price point? Do you take card payments or cash? Do you offer food? What's your customer service approach? How do you handle bad weather? Each decision affects whether the cart succeeds or fails.

Now multiply that complexity for a full sized venture. Where do you find customers? How do you reach them? What value proposition resonates? What's the right solution? How do you deliver it? What should you charge? What partnerships do you need? 

`[VISUAL TEXT: Hundreds of decisions | Each one matters]`

For purpose-driven ventures, this complexity is amplified. You need to integrate an impact model into an already complex business model. You're juggling customer value creation and impact delivery simultaneously.

If we don't use a systematic process to design our business model, we're just guessing. And guessing is a recipe for burnout, failure, and wasted potential.

Design beats guesswork.

testable, and faster to execute.

26
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:25,557
A coffee cart.

27
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,492
You sell great coffee
that's creating value.

28
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,767
You're at a train station where
commuters pass by on their way

29
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:33,777
to work that's delivering value.

30
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,682
You charge $5 cash or card for a cup
of coffee that's capturing value.

31
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:43,025
You watch both the price of beans,
staff hours and permit fees.

32
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:44,165
That's managing costs.

33
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:49,875

one more dimension, creating impact.

34
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:55,587

36
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:05,288
If we map the simple business model
definition to the social link canvas,

37
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:09,855
we have the customer model, how you
create value, who you serve, the job

38
00:02:09,855 --> 00:02:14,145
they need, done the promise, they'll
respond to the solution you'll deliver.

39
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:18,168
The impact model, how you
create impact From the issue.

40
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:22,274
You care about your activities and the
outcomes you'll generate through to

41
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:24,074
the ultimate impact you're aiming for.

42
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:29,116
And the economic model, the business
model's engine,  You deliver value

43
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:33,376
through channels, capture value through
revenue, and manage costs in your cost

44
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:33,856
section.

45
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:37,909
Advantage captures the leverage
that makes your model powerful.

00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:52,022
So why should we bother
designing our business model?

50
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,130
Why not just take an idea
and start executing on it?

51
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:56,878
from the outside.

52
00:02:56,938 --> 00:02:58,438
Business models can look simple.

53
00:02:58,768 --> 00:03:02,668
You make something, you sell something,
but in reality, there are hundreds of

54
00:03:02,668 --> 00:03:04,738
decisions that shape a business model.

55
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:07,697
Each one nudges you
towards success or failure.

56
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:10,065
Think about the coffee cart example.

57
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:11,325
Looks simple, right?

58
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,190
But underneath there
are dozens of choices.

59
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,078
Which station do you set up At?

60
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,630
What hours do you operate?

61
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,280
What coffee beans do you buy?

62
00:03:19,504 --> 00:03:20,734
What level of quality?

63
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:22,678
What price point  do you take?

64
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:24,088
Card payments or cash?

65
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:25,358
Do you offer food?

66
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:27,374
What's your customer service approach?

67
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,958
How do you handle bad weather?

68
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:33,128
Each decision affects whether
the cart succeeds or fails.

69
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:36,371
Now, multiply that complexity
for a full-sized venture.

70
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,683
Where do you find customers?

71
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:39,853
How do you reach them?

72
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:41,833
What value proposition resonates?

73
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,345
What's the right solution?

74
00:03:43,563 --> 00:03:44,553
How do you deliver it?

75
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:45,973
What should you charge?

76
00:03:46,063 --> 00:03:49,574
What partnerships do you need
For purpose driven ventures,

77
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:51,194
this complexity is amplified.

78
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:55,686
You need to integrate an impact model
into an already complex business model.

79
00:03:56,063 --> 00:04:00,423
You're juggling customer value creation
and impact delivery simultaneously.

80
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,371
if we don't use a systematic
process to design our business

81
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:05,721
model, we're just guessing.

82
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:10,014
And guessing is a recipe for burnout,
failure, and wasted potential.
