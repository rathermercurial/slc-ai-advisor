## Section 5.1.5: Validating Your Impact Model

**Tag line: "Prove your theory of change"**

### Why Impact Validation Matters

Now you have a plan for how you are going to validate your customer model. You need to do the same for your impact model.

`[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas - highlight Impact Model section]`

This matters deeply. There's a sad history of organizations who had the best intentions about the positive impact they planned to create, only to find out - sometimes much later - that they actually made the problem worse.

If important parts of your impact model don't work, you need to find out early so you can evolve your model into something that can work.

The stakes are high. You're working with people's lives, communities, and environments. Getting this right is not optional.

### Building on Your Module 4 Work

In Module 4, you worked through improving your impact model. You mapped your theory of change - the causal chain from activities through outcomes to impact. You tested the logic with experts and people with lived experience. You identified the riskiest assumptions.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Module 4 = theory of change | Module 5 = prove it works]`

Now you need to validate those assumptions. You're going to test whether your impact model actually creates the change you predict.

### What to Validate: Walking the Causal Chain

You need to validate assumptions across all the components of your impact model.

`[MAIN PANEL: Impact Model section with components highlighted]`

**Issue** - Are you addressing the right problem? Is this the root cause or just a symptom?

**Participants** - Will they engage in your activities as predicted? Do they have the capacity and motivation you assume?

**Activities** - Can you actually deliver these activities as planned? Do you have the capability and resources?

**Short-term Outcomes** - Do your activities create the immediate changes you predict? This is what you can measure quickly.

**Medium-term Outcomes** - Do the short-term outcomes build into the one to two year effects you predict? This takes longer to validate.

**Long-term Outcomes** - Do the medium-term outcomes create the sustained changes over two to ten years that you predict?

**Impact** - Does the ultimate state of change align with your Purpose?

### Toast Ale: Impact Model Assumptions

For our hypothetical Toast Ale founders, here's what they need to validate:

**Issue** - Is food waste actually a significant environmental problem? Are emissions from food waste as harmful as they believe?

**Participants** - Will bakeries partner with them to provide surplus bread? Will they do this reliably?

**Activities** - Can they collect bread efficiently? Can they brew beer at scale using surplus bread? Can they fund environmental charities with profits?

**Short-term Outcomes** - Does each batch of beer actually divert bread from landfill? Do they avoid the emissions that would have resulted?

**Medium/Long-term Outcomes** - Does scaling their beer production create measurable reduction in food waste? Do the charities they fund create environmental outcomes?

**Impact** - Does this contribute meaningfully to reducing environmental harm and fighting climate change?

Some of these can be validated quickly. Others will take years.

### Three Validation Approaches

Depending on how your impact model works, your validation approach may vary greatly.

It could be that your impact model is in a well-understood space and you're delivering a predictable intervention that produces predictable outcomes.

But you also might have an impact model that's trying to address a deep systemic social issue which requires discovery and sensemaking work in partnership with people who have lived experience of the issues you're addressing, and exploration across multiple interconnected and complex systems.

Depending on your particular impact model and how well validated it already is, there are three main approaches to validation that you can combine as part of your validation plan.

### Research: Leveraging Existing Knowledge

The first approach is research. Many aspects of your impact model may already be well understood. You can leverage existing studies and evidence rather than having to prove everything yourself.

`[VISUAL TEXT: research validates = causal logic | future outcomes | general space]`

Research can validate several things:

**The general space your impact model sits in** - How does the impact world think about the issue you're addressing? What are the different approaches to this issue that are already well understood? What has worked? What hasn't?

**Causal links in your theory of change** - Academic research, longitudinal studies, or evaluation reports might prove the connections between your short, medium, and long-term outcomes. You don't need to amass your own primary research on this.

**Future outcomes that would take too long to measure directly** - You might validate that a short-term outcome will result from an activity by running your own experiment. But you can rely on research into other organizations' experiences or academic studies to validate that the short-term outcome will drive the medium and long-term outcomes. This lets you have confidence in your full causal chain without waiting years to measure it yourself.

For Toast Ale, the environmental impacts of food waste are well researched. There are studies on emissions from food waste in landfills. Research on the carbon footprint of brewing. Data on how much bread waste is generated.

This research validates major parts of their impact logic without them having to prove it themselves.

### Experiments: Testing Your Specific Model

The second approach is experiments. Even when research validates general principles, you need to prove your specific approach works in your specific context.

`[MAIN PANEL: Experiment design framework]`

**Qualitative discovery** - If there are many unknowns about participants in your impact model and how they're going to respond to what you're trying to do, start with qualitative exploration. Talk to participants. Understand their context. Co-create solutions with them.

**Quantitative validation** - Once you understand the dynamics qualitatively, run pilots to measure whether activities create the outcomes you predict. Start small. Measure carefully. Scale when you have evidence it works.

For Toast Ale, they need experiments to validate their specific model:

**Qualitative** - Conversations with bakeries to understand their surplus bread situation. How much do they have? When? What would make partnership easy or difficult? Do they see value in this relationship?

**Quantitative** - A pilot with three bakeries collecting bread for three months. They measure: How much bread is actually diverted? How reliable is the collection process? What are the actual emissions avoided? Does the bread-to-beer conversion work at this scale?

They're not validating whether food waste is a problem - research already proved that. They're validating whether their specific activities can create the outcomes they predict.

`[VISUAL TEXT: qualitative = understand dynamics | quantitative = measure outcomes]`

### Leveraging Other People's Models: Strategic Partnership

The third approach is leveraging already validated impact models through strategic partnership.

Rather than developing and testing your own impact model from scratch, you could use resources you planned to allocate to impact delivery to fund another organization who already has a validated impact model and delivery mechanism.

This can be a powerful strategy, especially for organizations with complex social impact models that have lots of unknowns. It lets you side-step much of the complexity and cost of developing and testing your own impact model. You can focus on developing the other aspects of your business model while still creating impact.

Assuming the partner organization has a well-developed and successful impact model, you're inheriting their validation work. You're not starting from zero.

`[VISUAL TEXT: strategic partnership = inherit validated model | focus elsewhere]`

For Toast Ale, they use this approach for part of their impact model. Rather than trying to create environmental outcomes directly, they donate profits to fund environmental charities.

These charities have validated impact models for fighting climate change, protecting ecosystems, or addressing environmental issues. Toast Ale doesn't need to validate those impact pathways - they leverage the charities' proven work.

This lets Toast Ale focus their validation efforts on the food waste diversion part of their model, which is unique to them and needs their own proof.

### Choosing Your Validation Approach

For each assumption in your impact model, decide which approach makes sense:

Can existing research validate this? Use research.

Do you need to prove your specific approach works? Run experiments.

Could strategic partnership let you leverage someone else's validated model? Explore partnership.

Often you'll use all three approaches for different parts of your impact model. That's smart - use the right tool for each assumption.

`[VISUAL TEXT: research | experiments | partnership | use what fits]`

### Designing Your Validation Plan

Now take your risky assumptions from Module 4 and assign validation approaches to each.

For research: What studies exist? What do other organizations' experiences show? What can you learn from the field?

For experiments: What pilots can you run? What will you measure? How will you know if your activities are creating predicted outcomes?

For partnerships: Who has validated impact models you could leverage? What would partnership look like?

Remember that impact validation often takes longer than customer validation. Short-term outcomes might be measurable in months. Long-term outcomes might take years. Use research to validate future outcomes rather than waiting to measure them yourself.



**Create your validation plan document.** List your experiments in priority order, starting with the riskiest assumptions. For each experiment, document:
- What assumption(s) it tests
- How you'll run it (method, participants, scale)
- Success criteria (what proves it right or wrong)
- Timeline and resources needed

This plan becomes your input for building your strategy model
