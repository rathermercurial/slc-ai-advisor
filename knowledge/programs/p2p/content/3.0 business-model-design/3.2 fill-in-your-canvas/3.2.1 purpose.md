## P2P FRAMING

Making a purpose pivot into building your own venture isn't easy. When things get tough—and they will—you'll doubt yourself and doubt your idea. Or worse, you'll push ahead in the wrong direction if you're not anchored to something solid.

Engaging your purpose gives you a foundation. It supports you through the venture building journey. And it helps you communicate clearly to others—to collaborators, customers, investors—why this matters, why they should engage with what you're doing.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Foundation | Communication | Alignment]**

Purpose keeps you aligned when things get tough. It makes your marketing clear and compelling. And when you put purpose into your work, you get to be a fuller version of yourself. Who wants to go thorough the difficulty of pivoting to building their own venture, if it didn't allow them to more fully embody there values, passion and vision in the world

**Tag line:** **Purpose anchors you.**

**[MAIN PANEL: Spectrum graphic - Personal → Values → Impact]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework showed you how to craft your purpose statement. Now let's talk about what purpose means for you, when you are building a p2p venture. 

**Tag line:** **Purpose has range.**

---

### The Purpose Spectrum

You may be deep in the social enterprise space and developing a detailed impact model. Full theory of change, measurable outcomes, the whole thing.

Or your purpose might be building something that can reliably feed your family and allow you to contribute to your community. Creating a better life for the people close to you.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Feed family → Core values → Full impact model]**

Or you're somewhere in between

All of this is valid. The key is being clear about it.

**Tag line:** **All purpose is valid.**

### Why This Matters for Purpose Pivot Ventures

**[MAIN PANEL: Why this Matters for P2P Ventures]**

When you pivot to building your own thing, you get to fold more of yourself into it.

You're not spending the most productive years of your life working on things that don't matter to you—essentially making shareholders rich. You get to decide what matters.

When you put more of yourself into your venture, it gets more of your energy, inspiration, sweat, and love. You become a fuller, more integrated version of yourself and your venture benefits from this.

**[VISUAL TEXT: More of you → More energy]**

**Tag line:** **Bring your whole self.**

### Design is Never Neutral

**[MAIN PANEL: Simple diagram showing system → defaults → unintended outcomes]**

**Script (spoken):**

There's also a deeper design reason to integrate purpose into your venture. Most business ignore this, and it's a large reason the world is in the sorry state it's in today.

Design is never neutral.

Systems always encode values. If you don't explicitly design for a value, a combination of defaults, constraints, and incentives will work against that value.

**[VISUAL TEXT: No explicit design for X | System evolves against X]**

Much of the harm in the world isn't intentional. It's systems that weren't deliberately designed to protect the things we value. What they were designed to achieve—growth and profit—caused them to evolve in ways that are destructive to things we value, in society and in the environment. 

Twentieth-century businesses created massive environmental destruction. Not because they set out harm the environment. But because they didn't set out explicitly intending not harm the environment. The incentives around what they did intend to do—grow the business and make money for shareholders—caused them to make thousands of small decisions that resulted in environmental destruction. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Optimize for A | Destroy unstated B]**

This is why a slogan like "Don't be Evil" doesn't stop a complex system like a modern corporation from producing destructive outcomes. You need to consciously decide what values and outcomes to prioritize alongside growth and profit. And then actively design to ensure that those outcomes are produced.

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Honest Hustle"]**

This is why internet hustle culture feels so icky. It prioritizes personal success and nothing else, which really means it prioritized personal success at the expense of everything else.

Honest Hustle is about bringing energy, tenacity, hard work and smart thinking—but also knowing what we stand for. And not compromising on this. Not accidentally hurting people or our planet because we never considered that this might be a consequence of our actions. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Energy + tenacity + values]**

So even if your purpose isn't about an explicit social or environmental mission, you still need to understand what you stand for. What matters to you. And how you want to be in the world as you build your venture.

Your purpose will shape every decision you make. When things get hard, it'll make sure you stand firm on what's important and find a way to succeed without selling your soul.

**Tag line:** **Design with values.**

### Examples Across the Spectrum

**[MAIN PANEL: Example library preview showing different ventures]**

Want to see what purpose looks like at different points on the spectrum? Look in the P2P Example Library.

Different expressions of purpose—all legitimate.

The Core Example Library shows purpose-driven ventures across even wider range, including many social enterprises with comprehensive impact models.

### Practical Steps
**[VISUAL TEXT: Practical Steps]**

**[MAIN PANEL: Purpose box on canvas]**

Here's how to capture this:

If you're working with others, discuss your purpose and make sure you're aligned. Get on the same page early.

Keep it simple and powerful. Create a high-level description of why this matters. Capture that in your canvas along with any brief explanation that helps people understand.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Simple tagline | Brief explanation | Keep it clear]**

Details develop later in the Impact Model section. For the Purpose box, stay simple.

**Tag line:** **Simple and powerful.**

### Document Your Purpose

**[MAIN PANEL: Canvas with Purpose filled in]**

Document your purpose. Capture it in your canvas.

This becomes your north star. The thing you come back to when you're doubting, when decisions get hard, when you need to remember why you're doing this.
