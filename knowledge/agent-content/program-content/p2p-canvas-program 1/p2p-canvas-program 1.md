The Pivot to Purpose program is a wrapper on the core canvas program. 

It is designed for solo entrepreneurs, folks wanting to pivot away from traditional work and into entrepreneurship by building a small scale venture. It is designed as an antidote to all the hustle bro culture programs popular online by focusing on people who want to integrate a purpose that is meaningful to them into their venture's design. 

It contains both the core Social Lean Canvas program and Build programs but makes  relevant to a purpose driven solo entrepreneur audience. 

Many of the slugs introduce the core content, play the core content and then provide a commentary on it.
