## The Opportunity

**[MAIN PANEL: Changing landscape visual]**

There's something unique happening right now.

Traditional employment is being disrupted. Whole industries are changing. Jobs we thought would be there forever are vanishing.

But with this disruption along with all the uncertainty comes opportunity. Opportunity to reinvent how we work in unprecedented ways.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Disruption = opportunity | Reinvent how we work]**

This trend of solo founders and small teams building their own ventures has been emerging for a while, but AI is supercharging what's possible. One person can now build what used to take entire teams. A new kind of entrepreneur is emerging. 

People are stepping away from traditional jobs and building their own ventures. Small, purposeful and profitable.

We call this Pivoting to Purpose. 

**Tag line:** **The one-person startup is real.**

Pivoting to purpose describes making that step into building your own thing. Creating a new way of life for yourself. A way to generate income, wealth, financial freedom by doing something that you actually believe in. 

Here we focus on 2 important things - firstly size, Pivoting to Purpose is focused on small scale ventures that can be created by solo founders or very small teams, not high-growth startups and social enterprises. And secondly, this is about being purpose driven, stepping into doing something that matters to you. 

This program helps you navigate this step into entrepreneurship, it helps you make sense of what you are doing, helps you manage the risks you are taking, and helps you chart your best course through them to success. 

You might be mid career and looking to transition out of uninspiring work, or you could be self employed and looking build a venture that will scale your efforts beyond dollars for hours toil. Or you are new to the workforce starting out and just aren't inspired by the idea of spending the next few decades working a job you don't like for people you don't respect in service of a mission you don't believe in. 

Any of these sound like you? If so then your in the right place. 

This program is here to help you make this pivot. 


**Tag line:** **You're in the right place.**

## Purpose is your Advantage

**[MAIN PANEL: Purpose is your advantage - visual]**

And in a world becoming increasingly uncertain and untrustworthy, purpose becomes your advantage. It helps you cut through the noise.

Customers of ventures that have purpose at their heart are more engaged, more loyal and more likely to refer others. Purpose isn't just feel-good anymore - it's becoming a strategic advantage.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Purpose cuts through noise | Engaged customers | Strategic advantage]**

Whether you're trying to change the world take just build a foundation for your family's happiness, integrating your purpose into what you're building is now a complete no-brainer.

**Tag line:** **Purpose is advantage.**

## Building a Machine

**[MAIN PANEL: You're Building a Machine]**

In building your venture - You're not creating a job. You're building a machine.

In the past, leaving traditional employment meant becoming a freelancer or consultant. Trading the certainty of a job, for the uncertain of trading time for money.

But pivoting to building a venture is different. 

**[VISUAL TEXT: Not a job | Building a machine | Leverage on your time]**

You're building a business model that creates value beyond your time. A machine you own, that produces more than you could by yourself. That gives you leverage and creates financial independence.

And this, in turn creates more of the good things you're trying to manifest in the world.

**Tag line:** **Build a machine.**

We call this machine a Pivot Purpose venture - or p2p venture. A scalable repeatable business model, that enables you to pivot away from the traditional working world while pursuing things that are important to you. 

**Tag line:** **Building a P2P Venture.**

## How This Program Works
**[VISUAL TEXT: How the Program Works**

**[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas example]**

The Social Lean Canvas system has been developed over more than ten years. It's been used with thousands of social ventures, accelerators, and incubator programs.

It's the fastest and most reliable way to map, test, and build ideas into successful business models.

**[VISUAL TEXT: 10+ years | Thousands of ventures | Proven system]**

The canvas maps your entire business model. Everything visible. Details and big picture together.

**Tag line:** **See everything at once.**

---

**[MAIN PANEL: Scale spectrum visual - solo to corporation]**

This isn't a narrow methodology that tries to squeeze every venture into one-size-fits-all.

The canvas system can support all kinds of entrepreneurs that want to take a purpose-driven approach to building a venture

It works for a solo founder creating something they can run by themselves. It works for building a giant corporation or social enterprise. And everything in between.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Solo entrepreneur → Corporation | Universal framework | Any scale]**

In Pivoting to Purpose, we're focusing on starting small - solo or small team ventures. But the Social Lean Canvas can handle any direction you choose to go in.

The framework is universal. Your application of it is specific.

**Tag line:** **Universal framework, your scale.**

---

**[MAIN PANEL: Three models integration diagram]**

The canvas weaves together three models that work as a system:

Your Customer Model - how your venture creates value for customers.

Your Impact Model - the logic for how your venture delivers on your purpose.

And Your Economic Model - how money flows through your venture to make it financially successful.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Customer Model | Impact Model | Economic Model]**

These three models interrelate. They influence each other. Together, they form your complete business model.

**Tag line:** **Three models, one system.**

---

**[MAIN PANEL: Program structure - three modules]**

The p2p program is structured in three modules. Each module builds on the last. And Each creates a clear deliverable.

**Tag line:** **Three modules ahead.**

### How It Builds

**[MAIN PANEL: Progressive building visual showing module connections]**

Each module creates a deliverable. Each deliverable feeds the next.

Module 1 gives you your canvas. Module 2 strengthens it. Module 3 turns it into an executable strategy.

Progressive clarity. Going from vague idea to concrete plan.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Map | Improve | Execute | Progressive clarity]**

Then your canvas and your strategy evolve as you develop your venture. As you build your venture you loop through this process folding in learning and progress as you go.  Each time through, your business model gets stronger. Your strategy gets clearer. Uncertainty gets replaced with proof. 
These become your single source of truth, you canvas the description of the business model you are going to succeed with, and your strategy, the plan that you are executing on to get there.


Then this process repeats.

As you execute your strategy. You run experiments. You learn. Some assumptions prove true, others don't. You discover new insights.

Then you come back through. Update your canvas with what you learned. Improve it based on new knowledge. Rebuild your strategy. Execute again.

**[MAIN PANEL: Iterative cycle diagram]**

Each time through, your business model gets stronger. Your strategy gets clearer. Uncertainty gets replaced with proof.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Execute → Learn → Improve → Strategize → Execute]**

This is how you go from idea to success. Not in one pass, but through systematic iteration.
