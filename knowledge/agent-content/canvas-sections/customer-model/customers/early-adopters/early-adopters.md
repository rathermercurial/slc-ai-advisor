# Early Adopters
## Definition

**Early Adopters** are the small subgroup of your customer segments who you think will have the strongest desire for your solution. These are the customers you will engage with first to learn from and test out your ideas.

## Early Adopters

- **Subset of Customer Segments**: Early adopters exist within your broader customer segments
- **Strongest Motivation**: They have an amplified for your solution. They need you job-to-be-done most urgently
- **Testing Partners**: They provide initial feedback and validation. They will accept an early version of your solution
- **Learning Opportunity**: They help you refine your solution before broader market entry

## Key Principles

- Ensure that they are actually represent your identified customer segments and are not instead just a small but different customer segment/market
- Early adopters will be already looking for and trying out solutions for the job-to-be-done that you have identified. If they aren't then they are probably not early adopters.
