<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
You're about to work through the Core content on improving your economic model. This is where you assess whether your economics are likely to actually work and how to strengthen them.

The Core Framework covers unit economics, breakeven analysis, growth assessment, and leverage types. Pay attention to the breakeven math and the leverage discussion - what makes business models powerful.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Unit economics | Breakeven | Growth | Leverage]**

After the Core content, we'll connect this to your customer model work and talk about what economic model improvement looks like at p2p scale.

**Tag line:** **Make the economics work.**

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "Economic Model for PPVs"]**

**Script (spoken):**

The Core Framework just walked you through improving your economic model. Unit economics, breakeven, growth potential, leverage types, strategic improvement levers.

Now let's talk about what this means for p2p Ventures.

**Tag line:** **P2P economic improvement.**

### From Customer Math to Economic Reality

**[MAIN PANEL: Connect Customer Model math to Economic Model]**

Back in the Customer Model section, we did the TAM times ARPU math. Remember the example? You need $100k income plus $20k costs equals $120k revenue.

Now let's make that concrete in economic model terms. How do you actually hit that number?

**[VISUAL TEXT: $120k revenue target | How to get there?]**

Work backwards from your revenue target.

If you need $120k in revenue and your gross margin is fifty percent - meaning half of every dollar goes to costs of goods sold - you actually need $240k in total revenue to net $120k after COGS.

Or you need to improve your gross margin. At eighty percent gross margin, you only need $150k total revenue to net $120k.

**[VISUAL TEXT: 50% margin = $240k needed | 80% margin = $150k needed]**

Then factor in your customer acquisition. If you need 1,000 customers at $150 each, and your conversion rate from visitor to customer is two percent, you need 50,000 visitors to your site, platform or shop.

Can your channels deliver that? How long will it take to build that traffic?

This is how you connect customer model assumptions to economic model reality. The math has to work all the way through.

**Tag line:** **Connect the math.**

---

### Channel Assessment at P2P Scale

**[MAIN PANEL: Channel types with cost indicators]**

The Core Framework showed you Pirate Metrics - Acquisition, Activation, Revenue, Retention, Referral. This helps you map customer flow and understand whether your channels can deliver the volume you need.

For p2p ventures, channel assessment matters even more because you probably can't afford expensive customer acquisition.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Limited acquisition budget | Need efficient channels]**

Organic-first channels typically work best. Content marketing where you build an audience over time. SEO where customers find you through search. AI discovery where customers find your to AI queries, Community where members bring other members. Word-of-mouth that compounds.

Leveraging platforms can be powerful - app stores, marketplaces, plugin directories. These platforms have built-in discovery. They contain customers who might already there looking for solutions like yours.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Content/SEO | Community | Platforms | Word-of-mouth]**

Calculate what customer acquisition cost your unit economics can support. Take your gross margin per customer and divide by three or four. That's roughly what you can afford to spend acquiring each customer and still be sustainable.

If your gross margin per customer is sixty dollars, you can probably afford fifteen to twenty dollars in CAC. If your planned acquisition channel costs fifty dollars per customer, your economics don't work.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Gross margin ÷ 3 or 4 = max affordable CAC]**

This constraint narrows your channel options significantly. But that's helpful. It focuses you on channels that actually work for your model.

**Tag line:** **Affordable acquisition.**

---

### Advantage and Leverage at Small Scale

**[MAIN PANEL: Leverage types diagram]**

Back when we filled in the Economic Model, we covered different leverage types. The Core Framework just went even deeper - the iPhone example, the Patagonia example, all the ways leverage multiplies value.

For p2p ventures, the question is: what leverage is actually accessible to you at small scale? The following forms of leverage are often good sources of advantage for ventures like yours:

**[VISUAL TEXT: What leverage works small?]**

**Product leverage** works well. Courses instead of one-on-one coaching. Templates instead of custom work. SaaS instead of services. You build once, sell many times. This is classic product leverage - pulling together value creation into a scalable product.

**Technology leverage** through platforms is hugely accessible. Stripe handles payments. Substack manages subscribers. Shopify runs e-commerce infrastructure. You leverage their technology without having to build it yourself.

**Network leverage** can work at small scale. Members recruit other members. They create content. They provide support to each other. The community becomes self-reinforcing. Even modest network effects can create meaningful leverage.

**Perceptual leverage** through personal brand is naturally solo-friendly. Your unique voice, your specific expertise, your authentic perspective. This form of perceptual leverage can't be replicated and doesn't require scale to be effective.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Product | Technology | Network | Perceptual]**

Some forms of leverage typically require more resources. **Capital leverage** needs significant funds to invest. **Strategic leverage** often requires market position and influence. It's worth understanding which types of leverage are realistically available to you.

**Tag line:** **Accessible leverage.**

---

### P2P Constraints and Focus

**[MAIN PANEL: Constraint framework diagram]**

We've already talked about channels - direct sales teams and high-touch enterprise sales typically don't work solo. But there are other constraints worth thinking through.

These aren't absolute rules. There might be ways to make these work for your specific model. But for most P2P ventures, these patterns create challenges.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Common challenges for PPVs]**

**Subsidizing growth** is probably difficult. Without VC funding or other significant capital, you likely need positive unit economics from early on. You can't burn money acquiring customers while you figure out monetization later on.

**Long sales cycles** are probably challenging. If deals take six months to close and require constant nurturing, that's hard to manage solo while also building product and serving existing customers.

**High-touch onboarding** might not scale. If every new customer requires hours of your time to get started, you hit capacity quickly. Self-service or automated onboarding probably works better.

**High churn** is probably unsustainable. If you're losing customers as fast as you acquire them, and acquisition is expensive for you, the economics probably won't work. Strong retention becomes critical.

**High physical footprint** is probably unaffordable. Funding and maintaining your own premises, production facilities or event spaces is probably out of reach.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Positive unit economics early | Self-serve onboarding | Strong retention needed]**

These constraints can actually help. They narrow your options and focus you on economic models that are more likely to work at your scale.

**Tag line:** **Constraints focus.**

---

### Two Primary Levers: ARPU and Costs

**[MAIN PANEL: ARPU increase and Cost reduction levers]**

At p2p scale, you have two primary levers for improving your economic model.

First, **increase ARPU** - Annual Revenue Per User. Get more money from each customer. You can try:
- Premium positioning. Charge more by serving a segment that values what you do and has ability to pay.
- Bundling. Combine products or services to increase transaction value.
- Move upmarket. Serve customers who have bigger budgets and pay higher prices.
- Annual vs monthly pricing. Get customers to commit for a year instead of month-to-month or event by event. This improves both cash flow and retention.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Premium positioning | Bundling | Upmarket | Annual pricing]**

Flip the math and work on the revenue model backwards - If you need 1,000 customers at $120 per year to hit your target, doubling ARPU to $240 means you only need 500 customers. Half the acquisition required. How might this work? 


Second lever: **reduce costs.** Lower your cost of goods sold or your fixed costs. You can try:
- Automate non-core work. Use AI for customer support, content creation, data analysis - tasks that don't require your direct expertise.
- Platform versus custom build. Use existing platforms instead of building everything yourself. Much lower costs.
- Outsource strategically. Contractors for specialized work you need occasionally, not full-time staff.
- Partner to access physical spaces and equipment without needing to acquire your own

**[VISUAL TEXT: Automate with AI | Use platforms | Strategic contractors]**

Flip the math and work backwards for this too. If your COGS is eighty dollars per customer and you reduce it to sixty dollars, your gross margin per customer increases by twenty dollars. Multiply that by 1,000 customers - that's $20k more profit. How might you achieve this?

Both levers are powerful. And sometimes you can pull both simultaneously.

**Tag line:** **Two levers, big impact.**

---

### Use AI for Economic Research

**[MAIN PANEL: Research workflow diagram]**

Throughout the improvement process, use AI tools to accelerate your research and analysis.

Research pricing in your industry and category. What do similar products or services charge? What's the range? Where could you position?

Find unit economics benchmarks for similar business models. What gross margins are typical? What CAC is normal? This helps you assess whether your numbers are realistic.

Analyze competitor pricing and positioning. How do they structure their offers? What value propositions support their pricing?

**[VISUAL TEXT: Pricing research | Unit economics benchmarks | Competitor analysis]**

Identify cost reduction opportunities. What could be automated in your model? Where could AI replace manual work? What platforms could you use instead of custom building?

Research channel effectiveness. Which acquisition channels work well for ventures similar to yours? What conversion rates are realistic? What does CAC look like for different channels?

Generate ideas for ARPU improvement or cost reduction. AI is good at pattern matching across industries and suggesting approaches you might not have considered.

This research accelerates the improvement work significantly. You're not guessing. You're making informed decisions based on what's working elsewhere.

**Tag line:** **Research accelerates improvement.**

### Your Turn

**[MAIN PANEL: Economic Model section on blank canvas]**

Now apply this to your own economic model. 

Follow the instructions from the core content and document the assumptions you are making these will flow into the validation process. But keep in mind how you are different as a p2p ventures and what the particular needs of your business model are.

And how to strengthen them.

4
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:14,704
The core framework covers unit

assessment, and leverage types.

6
00:00:16,864 --> 00:00:20,044
Pay attention to the breakeven

00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:30,809
improvement looks like at P two P scale.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
The core framework just walked you
through improving your economic

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,104
model, unit economics, breakeven
growth, potential leverage types,

3
00:00:07,137 --> 00:00:08,777
strategic improvement levers.

4
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:12,327
Now let's talk about what this
means for P two P ventures.

5
00:00:13,011 --> 00:00:17,361
Back in the customer model section,
we did the tam times, arpu maths.

6
00:00:17,592 --> 00:00:18,762
Remember the example.

7
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:24,301
You need $100,000 income plus
$20,000 in costs, which equals

8
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:26,911
$120,000 in revenue that you need.

9
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:28,813
Now let's make this concrete.

10
00:00:28,813 --> 00:00:32,173
In economic model terms, how do
you actually hit that number?

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,990
Work backwards from your revenue
target  If you need $120,000 in revenue.

12
00:00:38,307 --> 00:00:42,533
And you have a gross margin of
50%, meaning half of every dollar

13
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:44,663
goes to costs of goods sold.

14
00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:52,183
You actually need $240,000 in total
revenue to net $120,000 after cogs,

15
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,482
Or you need to improve your gross margin.

16
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:56,588
80% gross margin.

17
00:00:56,618 --> 00:01:03,487
You only need $150,000 in total
revenue to net $120,000 after cogs then

18
00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:05,287
factor in your customer acquisition.

19
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:11,257
If you need a thousand customers at
$150 each per year, and your conversion

20
00:01:11,257 --> 00:01:13,627
rate from visitor customers is 2%.

21
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:17,814
You need 50,000 visitors to
your site, platform, or shop.

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,090
Can your channels deliver that?

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,700
How long will it take
to build that traffic?

24
00:01:23,388 --> 00:01:28,038
This is how you connect customer model
assumptions to economic model realities.

25
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:33,883
The core customer framework showed the
pirate metrics acquisition, activation,

26
00:01:33,883 --> 00:01:35,923
revenue, retention, and referral.

27
00:01:36,258 --> 00:01:39,282
This helps you map  and understand
whether your channels can

28
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:40,752
deliver the volume that you need.

29
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:44,538
For P two P Ventures, channel
assessment matters even more

30
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:48,011
because you probably can't afford
expensive customer acquisition.

31
00:01:48,377 --> 00:01:52,307
Organic first channels typically
work best content marketing, where

32
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:55,984
you build an audience over time,
SEO, where customers find you

33
00:01:55,984 --> 00:02:00,754
through search AI discovery, where
customers find you through AI queries.

34
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:05,053
Community where members bring other
members, word of mouth that compounds

35
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,860
leveraging platforms can be powerful.

36
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:10,952
App stores, marketplaces,
plugin directories.

37
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,259
These platforms have built in discovery.

38
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:16,979
They contain customers who might already
be looking for solutions like yours.

39
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:22,401
Calculate what customer acquisition
cost your unit economics can support.

40
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,693
Take your gross margin per customer
and divide it by three or four.

41
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:31,368
That's roughly what you can afford to
spend acquiring each customer and still

42
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:37,159
be sustainable  if your gross margin per
customer is $60, you can probably afford

43
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:40,489
15 to $20 in cost of customer acquisition.

44
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:44,775
If your planned acquisition
channel costs $50 per customer,

45
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:46,395
your economics won't work.

46
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:51,639
This constraint narrows your channels
option significantly, but it's helpful.

47
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:55,719
It focuses you in on channels
that actually work for your model.

48
00:02:56,764 --> 00:02:59,988
Back when we filled in the
economic model of your canvas, we

49
00:02:59,988 --> 00:03:01,908
covered different leverage types.

50
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:04,572
The core framework just went even deeper.

51
00:03:04,861 --> 00:03:08,582
The iPhone example and the
Patagonia example, all show ways

52
00:03:08,582 --> 00:03:10,412
that leverage multiplies value.

53
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:14,406
For P two P ventures, the question
is what leverage is actually

54
00:03:14,406 --> 00:03:16,536
accessible to you at small scale?

55
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,549
The following forms of leverage are
often good sources of advantage.

56
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:24,984
For a venture like yours, product
leverage works well courses instead of

57
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:29,851
one-to-one coaching templates instead
of custom work SaaS instead of services

58
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:32,173
you build once, sell many times.

59
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:35,873
This is classic product leverage,
pulling together value creation

60
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:36,473
into a scalable product.

61
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:41,316
Technology leverage through
platforms is hugely accessible.

62
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:45,276
Stripe handles payments,
Substack managers, subscribers.

63
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,826
Shopify runs e-commerce infrastructure.

64
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,170
You leverage their technology
without having to build it yourself.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,100
Network leverage can work
at small scale as well.

66
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,485
Members recruit other members.

67
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:57,755
They create content.

68
00:03:57,969 --> 00:03:59,735
They provide support to each other.

69
00:03:59,964 --> 00:04:02,214
The community becomes self-reinforcing.

70
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:05,814
Even modest network effects
can create meaningful leverage.

71
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:10,404
Perceptual leverage through a personal
brand is a natural, solo friendly fit.

72
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:15,264
Your unique voice, your specific
expertise, your authentic perspective.

73
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:19,264
This form of perceptual leverage
can't be replicated, and it doesn't

74
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:20,944
require scale to be effective.

75
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:24,669
Some forms of leverage typically
require more resources.

76
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:27,849
Capital leverage needs
significant funds to invest.

77
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:32,108
Strategic leverage often requires
market position and influence.

78
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,798
It's worth understanding
which types of leverage are

79
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:36,478
realistically available to you.

80
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:40,613
We've already talked about channels,
direct sales teams, and high touch

81
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,693
enterprise sales typically don't work
solo,  but there are other P two P

82
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:46,733
constraints worth thinking about as well.

83
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:48,442
These aren't absolute rules.

84
00:04:48,675 --> 00:04:51,915
There might be ways to make these
work for your specific model,

85
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:55,608
but for most P two P ventures,
these patterns create challenges.

86
00:04:56,241 --> 00:05:00,091
Subsidizing growth is probably
difficult without VC funding

87
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,831
or other significant capital.

88
00:05:01,972 --> 00:05:05,234
You likely need positive
unit economics from early on.

89
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:08,612
You can't burn money acquiring
customers while you figure

90
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:10,232
out monetization later on.

91
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,366
Long sales cycles are
probably challenging.

92
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:17,655
If deals take six months to close
and require constant nurturing that's

93
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:21,734
hard to manage solo while building a
product and serving existing customers.

94
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:24,523
High touch onboarding might not scale.

95
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:28,631
If every customer requires hours of
your time to get started, you hit

96
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:30,380
capacity constraints pretty quickly.

97
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:34,046
Self-service or automated onboarding
probably works better for you.

98
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:36,876
High tune is probably unsustainable.

99
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:40,379
If you're losing customers as
fast as you acquire them and

100
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,274
acquisition is expensive for you, the
economics probably won't work out.

101
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:47,854
Strong retention becomes
critical at P two P scale.

102
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:52,673
High physical footprint is probably
unaffordable funding and maintaining

103
00:05:52,673 --> 00:05:56,417
your own premises, production,
facilities, or event spaces is

104
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:58,247
probably out of reach at your scale.

105
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:03,599
These constraints can actually help
they narrow your options and focus

106
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:06,968
you on economic models that are
more likely to work at your scale.

107
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:12,517
At P two P scale, you have two primary
levers for improving your economic model.

108
00:06:12,726 --> 00:06:15,666
First, increasing ARPU
annual revenue per user.

109
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,708
Get more money from each customer.

110
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:22,464
You can try premium positioning charge
more by serving a segment that values

111
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:24,553
what you do and has the ability to pay.

112
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:30,245
Bundling combine products or services
to increase transaction value, move

113
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:34,427
up market, serve customers who have
bigger budgets and pay higher prices.

114
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:36,825
Annual versus monthly pricing.

115
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:41,257
Get customers to commit to full
year instead of month to month,

116
00:06:41,287 --> 00:06:45,521
or event by event  this improves
both cash flow and retention.

117
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:49,083
Flip the math and work on
the revenue model backwards.

118
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:55,422
If you need a thousand customers at $120
each per year to hit your target, doubling

119
00:06:55,422 --> 00:07:01,682
your ARPU to $240 means you only need 500
customers, half the acquisition required.

120
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,281
How might you make this work?

121
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:04,991
The second lever.

122
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:06,131
Reduced costs.

123
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:09,364
Lower your costs of goods
sold, or your fixed costs.

124
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:12,802
You can try automate your non-core work.

125
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:18,185
Use AI for customer support, content
creation, data analysis tasks that

126
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:22,886
don't require your direct expertise
platform versus custom builds.

127
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:26,381
Use existing platforms instead
of building everything yourself.

128
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:27,341
Much lower cost.

129
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,251
Outsource strategically
contractors for specialized work.

130
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:34,677
You need occasionally not full-time staff.

131
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:38,689
Partner to access physical
spaces and equipment without

132
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,099
needing to acquire your own.

133
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,249
Flip the math and work
backwards for this too.

134
00:07:43,578 --> 00:07:48,961
If your cogs is $80 per customer
and you reduce it to $60, your gross

135
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:51,511
margin per customer increases by $20.

136
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:56,476
Multiply that by thousand customers,
that's $20,000 more profit.

137
00:07:56,617 --> 00:07:57,995
How might you achieve this?

138
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:02,949
Both levers are powerful and sometimes
you can pull both simultaneously.

139
00:08:03,946 --> 00:08:07,602
Throughout the improvement process,
use AI tools to accelerate your

140
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:11,312
research and analysis, researching
pricing in your industry and category.

141
00:08:11,485 --> 00:08:13,825
What does similar products
or services charge?

142
00:08:14,014 --> 00:08:15,034
What's the range?

143
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:19,086
Where could you position find
unit economics benchmarks

144
00:08:19,086 --> 00:08:20,526
for similar business models.

145
00:08:20,842 --> 00:08:23,003
What gross margins are, typical what?

146
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:23,873
CAC is normal.

147
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:26,921
This helps you assess whether
your numbers are realistic.

148
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:30,098
Analyze competitor
pricing and positioning.

149
00:08:30,391 --> 00:08:32,191
How do they structure their offers?

150
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:34,788
What value propositions
support their pricing?

151
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:38,048
Identify cost reduction opportunities.

152
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:40,232
What could be automated in your model?

153
00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:42,549
Where could AI replace manual work?

154
00:08:43,243 --> 00:08:48,778
platforms could you use instead of custom
building research channel effectiveness?

155
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,790
Which acquisition channels work
well for ventures of smaller sizes?

156
00:08:53,078 --> 00:08:54,908
What conversion rates are realistic?

157
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:57,580
What does CAC look like
for different channels?

158
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:02,140
Generate ideas for ARPU
improvement or cost reduction?

159
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:06,419
AI is good at patent matching across
industries and suggesting approaches

160
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:07,539
that you might not have considered.

161
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:11,359
This research accelerates your
improvement work significantly.

162
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:12,537
You're not guessing.

163
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:15,592
You're making informed decisions
based on what's working elsewhere.

164
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,710
Now apply this to your own economic model.

165
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:22,003
Follow the instructions from the
core content and document the

166
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:23,293
assumptions that you're making.

167
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:27,577
These will flow into the validation
process, but keep in mind how

168
00:09:27,577 --> 00:09:30,932
you're different as a P two P
venture and what the particular

169
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:32,312
needs of your business model are.
