# P2P (Pivot-to-Purpose) Program

The Pivot-to-Purpose (P2P) program is a specialized Social Lean Canvas learning journey designed for solo founders and small teams building purpose-driven ventures. It adapts the universal SLC methodology for the specific constraints, opportunities, and mindset of one-person and micro-team entrepreneurship. It guides them through a set of simple steps to support them in creating, improving, validating and building strategy for a purpose-driven business model.

## Program Overview

The P2P program serves solo and small-team entrepreneurs who want to:

- Build financially sustainable ventures aligned with their personal values
- Create "machines" (systems) rather than selling time for money
- Balance purpose, profit, and personal lifestyle
- Leverage modern tools (especially AI) to compete as small teams
- Build "honest hustle" ventures - strategic success with integrity

**Target Audience:** Mid-career professionals transitioning from uninspiring work, self-employed individuals seeking to scale beyond hours-for-dollars, or early-career individuals rejecting traditional employment to build their own path.

**Key Philosophy:**

- **"1,000 True Fans"** - Small, viable audiences over mass markets
- **Solo-viable complexity** - Simple models that don't require teams
- **AI-augmented** - Modern tools enable solo operation
- **Purpose as advantage** - Authentic mission cuts through noise

**Program Structure:** Single continuous program (Modules 2.0-5.8) integrating canvas creation, improvement, and strategy development.

| Modules | Purpose                  | Outcome                                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2.0     | P2P program introduction | Understanding P2P opportunity and mindset                    |
| 3.0-3.2 | Business model design    | Complete 11-section canvas for solo/small teams              |
| 4.0     | Improving business model | Strengthened models with solo-founder constraints considered |
| 5.0-5.8 | Strategy development     | Validation plans and executable strategy                     |

## The "Sandwich Approach" - Content Reuse Strategy

The P2P program uses a distinctive pedagogical pattern to contextualize Generic/Core content for solo founders:

### Pattern Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ P2P FRAMING                         │
│ (P2P-specific introduction)         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [INSERT CORE CONTENT: Topic]        │
│ (Reference to Generic content)      │
│ - Universal SLC framework           │
│ - Theoretical foundations           │
│ - General best practices            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ P2P COMMENTARY                      │
│ (P2P-specific application)          │
│ - Solo-founder tactics and mindset  │
│ - Practical constraints             │
│ - P2P examples                      │
│ - AI/tool enablement                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### How It Works

1. **P2P Framing** opens each topic with a short introduction to the core content and telegraphing return to P2P commentary after it

2. **Core Content Reference** e.g - `slc-ai-advisor/knowledge/programs/generic/content/3.0 business-model-design/3.2 fill-in-your-canvas/3.2.2 customer-model.md`
   to indicate where Generic program content should be inserted or referenced

3. **P2P Commentary** provides P2P-specific mindset shifts, opportunities, examples from the P2P library, and tactical guidance for solo founders

### Real Example: Customer Model (3.2.2)

From `3.2.2 customer-model.md`:

**P2P Framing:**

- "Next you are going to work through the Core content on the Customer Model"
- "After you've gone through the framework core, we'll come back and talk about what matters most for P2P ventures specifically"

**Core Content Directive:**

- `slc-ai-advisor/knowledge/programs/generic/content/3.0 business-model-design/3.2 fill-in-your-canvas/3.2.2 customer-model.md`

**P2P Commentary:**

- "1,000 True Fans" mindset shift
- Customer type complexity warnings
- P2P-specific constraints (channels, async communication)
- P2P examples: Plausible Analytics vs. Ridwell
- AI enablement for solo operation

### Content Inheritance vs. Replacement

**Inherited (Referenced):**

- Universal business model concepts
- Canvas section definitions
- The three models framework
- General best practices
- Some venture examples

**P2P-Specific (Replaced):**

- Program introductions (2.0)
- Some module introductions
- Some conclusions
- Context-setting and framing
- Application guidance

### Why This Approach?

**Benefits:**

- **Efficiency:** Reuse proven core content without duplication
- **Consistency:** Universal framework taught consistently
- **Specialization:** P2P-specific context where it matters
- **Maintainability:** Core content updates automatically benefit P2P

**For the AI Advisor:**

- When serving P2P users, combine P2P framing + Core content + P2P commentary
- Always contextualize Core concepts for solo/small-team constraints
- Reference P2P examples preferentially, Core examples secondarily
- Emphasize simplicity, solo-viability, and AI-augmentation themes

## Key Differences from Generic Program

### 1. Program Structure

**Generic:**

- Two distinct sub-programs (Canvas + Build)
- Modules 2.0-5.3
- Can be delivered separately

**P2P:**

- Single continuous program
- Modules 2.0-5.8
- Integrated journey

### 2. Module Organization

**Module 4.0 Structure:**

**Generic:** Nested subdirectories (up to 4 levels)

```
4.2 improving-your-customer-model/
  ├── 4.2.1 intro + customer segments.md
  ├── 4.2.2 assessing-your-customer-model.md
  ├── 4.2.3 improvement-levers.md
  └── 4.2.4 improvement-process.md
```

**P2P:** Flat file structure (with core sub-directories referenced with the P2P sections)

```
4.0 improving-your-business-model/
  ├── 4.2 improving-your-customer-model.md
  ├── 4.3 improving-your-impact-model.md
  └── 4.4 improving-your-economic-model.md
```

**Module 5.0 Naming:**

**Generic:** `5.0 developing-your-strategy/`
**P2P:** `5.0 strategy/`

**Module 5.0 Scope:**

**Generic:** Nested structure with sub-modules

- 5.1 designing-your-strategy/ (5.1.1-5.1.6)
- 5.2 building-your-strategy/ (5.2.1-5.2.3)
- 5.3 conclusion.md

**P2P:** Flat structure with 8 sequential modules (5.0-5.8)

### 3. Content Focus

**Generic:**

- Broad social entrepreneur audience
- Various legal structures (nonprofit, B-corp, LLC, cooperative)
- Teams of various sizes
- Multiple funding approaches
- Full spectrum of complexity

**P2P:**

- Solo founders and small teams (1-5 people)
- Focus on simple legal structures
- Bootstrapped and founder-controlled funding
- Emphasis on simplicity and solo-viability
- AI and automation as enablers
- Lifestyle and purpose alignment

## Content Format

P2P files follow same frontmatter pattern as Generic:

```yaml
---
title: ". customer Model" # Note: some titles use period prefix for P2P
tags:
  - customer-model
  - video-content
  - business-model-design
---
# P2P Script: 3.2.2 Customer Model

#CTX program:p2p | example:micro | visual:3 | cta:off | tag_line:on

## P2P FRAMING
[P2P-specific introduction...]
---
[INSERT CORE CONTENT: Customer Model]
---
## P2P COMMENTARY
[P2P-specific application and examples...]
```

**P2P-Specific Elements:**

- Context header: `#CTX program:p2p | example:micro | visual:3 | cta:off | tag_line:on`
- Video markers: `<span style="color:green">p2p 3.2.2 customer-model 1.webm.02.mp4.webm</span>`
- Visual cues: `**[MAIN PANEL: ...]**`, `**[VISUAL TEXT: ...]**`
- Tag lines: `**Tag line:** **Value creation starts here.**`
- Core content directives: `[INSERT CORE CONTENT: Topic]`

## Using This README

### For the AI Advisor

**Serving P2P Users:**

1. Identify user as P2P (solo founder, small team, specific language)
2. Use P2P framing + Core content + P2P commentary pattern
3. Reference P2P examples first, Generic examples secondarily
4. Emphasize simplicity, solo-viability, constraints
5. Mention AI/tool enablement where relevant

**Content Navigation:**

- P2P content is in `p2p/content/`
- Core content (when referenced) is in `generic/content/`
- P2P examples are in `p2p/examples/`
- P2P examples show solo/small-team patterns

**Module Mapping:**

- `2.0` → P2P-specific introduction
- `3.0-3.2` → P2P framing + Core content + P2P commentary
- `4.0` → Flat structure, single files per model
- `5.0-5.8` → Extended strategy module (8 sub-modules vs Generic's 2)

### For Human Maintainers

**Content Updates:**

- P2P framing and commentary: Edit in `p2p/content/`
- Core concepts and framework: Edit in `generic/content/` (automatically benefits P2P)
- P2P examples: Add to `p2p/examples/`
- Cross-program examples: Can live in Generic and be referenced from P2P

**Sandwich Pattern Maintenance:**

- Keep P2P framing distinct and contextual
- Maintain clear Core content references
- Ensure P2P commentary provides tactical application
- Use P2P examples to illustrate points

## Known Issues

**Content Organization:**

- Mix of folder-based examples (buy-me-once/, plausible-analytics/) and standalone files (tally.md, the-generalist.md)
- Inconsistent depth: Module 4.0 is flat while Generic nests deeper

**Suggested Fixes:**

- Standardize example format (all folders vs. all standalone)
