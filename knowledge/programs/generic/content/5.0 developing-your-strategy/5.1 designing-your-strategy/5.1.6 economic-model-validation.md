## Section 5.1.6: Validating Your Economic Model

**Tag line: "Prove the economics work"**

### Economic Model Powered by Customer Model

Now you have a plan to validate your customer model and your impact model, you need to figure out how you are going to validate your economic model.

`[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas - highlight Economic Model section]`

Your economic model is powered by your customer model. Your customer model creates value for customers. Your economic model delivers that value through channels, captures it through revenue, and manages the costs of doing this while also delivering your impact.

Here's the important point: Customer validation already started proving your economics.

### Building on Your Module 4 Work

In Module 4, you worked through improving your economic model. You calculated unit economics and breakeven. You figured out TAM times ARPU. You mapped your channels and identified how you'd capture revenue and manage costs.

And you identified the riskiest assumptions in your economic model.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Module 4 = unit economics | Module 5 = prove at scale]`

Now you're going to validate those assumptions. You're going to prove your economic model works at the scale you need.

### What Customer Validation Already Proved

Before diving into economic model validation, recognize what you will have already learned.

Your customer interviews will reveal pricing sensitivity. They'll tell you what people are willing to pay. That's revenue validation starting.

Your customer discovery tests channels too. They'll tell you where your early adopters hang out and how to reach them. That's channel validation starting.

Your early experiments - prototypes, pilots, small sales - will show that people will actually pay for your solution. That's proof your revenue model can work.

`[VISUAL TEXT: pricing tested | channels identified | willingness to pay proven]`

Economic validation builds on this foundation to prove that it works at scale.

### What to Validate: Walking Through Economic Components

You need to validate assumptions across all components of your economic model.  

`[MAIN PANEL: Economic Model section with components highlighted]`

You will not validate them all at once. But you do need to work through them systematically to be able to understand where the high priorities assumptions are. 

**Channels** - Can you reach customers at scale through these channels? What's your customer acquisition cost? What are the conversion rates at each stage? Do the channels work the way you predicted?

**Revenue** - Will customers pay the price you need? Is your ARPU calculation accurate? What are your retention rates? Do people come back and pay again?

**Costs** - Are your cost assumptions correct? What are your actual costs of goods sold? Your fixed costs? Your distribution costs?

And critically - if your impact model activities are separate from delivering your core product or service, what do those impact activities actually cost?

This is essential - you can't know if your overall economic model works without knowing your true cost structure, including impact delivery costs.

**Advantage** - Do your leverage points actually work as predicted? We'll come back to this.

`[VISUAL TEXT: channels | revenue | costs (including impact) | advantage]`

Often you'll validate these components together through integrated experiments. But let's look at each one.

### Toast Ale: Economic Components Validation

For our hypothetical Toast Ale founders, here's what they need to validate in each component:

**Channels**

They need to prove bottle shops work as a distribution channel at scale. Their customer discovery showed early adopters shop at craft beer stores. But can they get their beer into enough shops? What does distribution cost? What's the conversion rate from "sees it on shelf" to "buys it"?

Their bottle shop pilot with five hundred bottles across ten shops tests this. They're measuring how quickly beer moves, what shelf placement works, what the actual cost per bottle is to get it into shops.

**Revenue**

They need to prove people will pay 3 pounds per bottle at scale, not just in friendly tastings. They need to test whether ARPU holds up across different customer segments. Will people buy one bottle or multiple? Will they come back?

The pilot measures actual sales. Real money exchanged. No friendly discounts. This proves revenue assumptions.

**Costs**

They need to validate their cost structure across multiple areas:

Production costs - Can they brew at the cost they predicted? Does using surplus bread actually reduce malt costs enough to matter?

Distribution costs - What does it really cost to get beer into bottle shops and keep it stocked?

Impact model costs - This is critical. Can they collect surplus bread from bakeries at the cost they estimated? What are the logistics costs? How much do they need to donate to charities to deliver their impact model? 

`[MAIN PANEL: Toast Ale cost structure breakdown]`

Without validating these impact activity costs, they can't know if their overall economics work. The bread collection and charity funding are part of their cost structure and need to be proven.

**Advantage**

Toast Ale believes their sustainability mission creates an advantage - that the environmental story will drive sales above what a regular craft beer could expect. Does this actually work?

The pilot tests this. Are people willing to pay a premium? Does the mission-aligned positioning increase conversion rates? Is word-of-mouth stronger than for comparable beers without the mission angle?

### AARRR Framework as Validation Tool

The Pirate Metrics framework - AARRR - gives you a useful lens for designing economic validation experiments.

`[MAIN PANEL: AARRR funnel diagram]`

**Acquisition** - How many potential customers become aware of your product?

**Activation** - How many engage with it?

**Revenue** - How many pay?

**Retention** - How many come back and pay again?

**Referral** - How many tell others?

`[VISUAL TEXT: Acquisition → Activation → Revenue → Retention → Referral]`

For Toast Ale's bottle shop pilot, they're testing the entire funnel:

Acquisition - How many people see the beer on the shelf?

Activation - How many pick it up and read the label?

Revenue - How many buy it?

Retention - How many come back to buy more?

Referral - How many tell friends or ask retailers to keep stocking it?

This framework helps you design experiments that test your economic model systematically.

### MVP: Integrated Validation

Often the most efficient way to validate your economic model is through an MVP - a minimum viable product that tests multiple assumptions simultaneously.

Remember the three circles model from Section 3.1? Circle one is your MVP. Circle two is the version of your venture that can reach success. The MVP tests the core assumptions you need to prove to get from circle one to circle two.

`[MAIN PANEL: Three circles diagram with MVP and success highlighted]`

Toast Ale's bottle shop pilot is exactly this kind of MVP. It's not just validating economics - it's validating customer, economic, and some impact assumptions all at once.

Customer assumptions - People will buy beer positioned as fighting food waste.

Economic assumptions - Channels work, pricing works, costs are manageable, conversion rates support the model.

Impact assumptions - Bread collection is feasible, waste is actually diverted.

`[VISUAL TEXT: MVP = customer + economic + impact validation]`

This integrated approach is efficient. One experiment validates multiple models simultaneously.

When you're designing your economic validation plan, look for these integrated MVP opportunities. Don't test everything separately if you can test multiple assumptions together.

### Advantage Validation

Different types of advantage need different validation approaches.

`[MAIN PANEL: Examples of advantage types]`

If your advantage is network effects, you need to test whether growth actually accelerates as you add users.

If it's economies of scale, you need to test whether unit costs actually decrease as volume increases.

If it's brand, you need to test whether brand awareness reduces customer acquisition costs or increases conversion rates.

If it's intellectual property, you need to test whether your IP creates defensibility that competitors can't replicate.

If it's mission alignment - like Toast Ale - you need to test whether your purpose-driven positioning actually drives sales above what you'd expect without it.

For Toast Ale, they're testing: Does the sustainability story create an advantage? They compare their conversion rates and word-of-mouth to similar craft beers without the environmental mission. If their rates are higher, the advantage is real.

### Designing Your Validation Plan

Now take your risky economic assumptions from Module 4 and design experiments to validate them.

For each assumption, ask:

What's the fastest, cheapest way to test this at scale?

Can I test multiple assumptions together through an integrated MVP?

What have I already validated through customer discovery?

What success criteria will prove this assumption correct?

`[VISUAL TEXT: fastest test | integrate MVPs | build on customer work | clear criteria]`

Balance single-assumption tests with integrated experiments. Sometimes you need to isolate one variable. Sometimes an MVP that tests everything together is smarter.

Remember that some costs are straightforward to model - like courier services or standard production costs. Focus your validation efforts on the uncertain costs, especially your impact model delivery costs if those are significant.

**Create a validation plan document.** List your experiments in priority order, starting with the riskiest assumptions. For each experiment, document:

- What assumption(s) it tests
- How you'll run it (method, participants, scale)
- Success criteria (what proves it right or wrong)
- Timeline and resources needed



This plan becomes your input for building your strategy model 

Once this is complete, it's time to build your strategy.
