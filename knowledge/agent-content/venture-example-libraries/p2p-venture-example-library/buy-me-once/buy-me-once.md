- **Founder & start:** Founded by **Tara Button** in **2016** after a “buy-for-life” epiphany; she later wrote [_A Life Less Throwaway_](https://buymeonce.com/pages/a-life-less-throwaway). See the company’s [About](https://buymeonce.com/pages/about-us) and a concise timeline on Tara’s site. 
    
- **What it is:** An online store curating **long-lasting, repair-ready products** (US: [buymeonce.com](https://buymeonce.com) • UK: [buymeonce.co.uk](https://www.buymeonce.co.uk/)) with a mission to “change the way we shop, from buying for the short term to buying once.” They also offer **exclusive warranties** on select items. 
    
- **How it makes money:** **Direct retail margins** from its own shop; the UK research pages explicitly say “**Buy through us to support our independent research**” and note a **price-match** stance. 
    
- **How they pick products:** A published, **data-driven methodology** for finding the most durable “buy-it-for-life” items. 
    
- **Recent signals (2025):** Ongoing research content (e.g., [_Most Reliable Kettles — UK 2025_](https://www.buymeonce.co.uk/blogs/research/most-reliable-kettles-uk-2025); [_Best Buy-It-For-Life Bluetooth Speaker — UK 2025_](https://www.buymeonce.co.uk/blogs/research/best-buy-it-for-life-bluetooth-speaker-uk-2025)). 
    
- **Team size (directional):** Small, lean operation; third-party data platforms estimate **single-digit to low-teens employees**. (Examples: PitchBook lists **~9**, Growjo **~14**.) Treat as approximate. 
    

  

### **Why it’s relevant to SLC (solo-preneur lens)**

- **Purpose-first retail**: The whole proposition fights planned obsolescence and over-consumption with **durability and repairability** at the core. 
    
- **Lean, repeatable playbook**: A small team + **research-led editorial** → curated catalog → **owned-store conversion** (with warranties/price-match as trust levers).
