**Tag line: "From validation to execution"**

### Bringing It All Together

You've done the hard work. You've created validation plans for your customer model, your impact model, and your economic model. You know what assumptions need testing and how you'll test them.

Now you need to bring all of this together into one coherent strategy that you can actually execute.

`[MAIN PANEL: The three validation plans side by side]`

That's what a strategy model does. It takes your validation plans and turns them into an execution roadmap. It shows what happens when, in what order, and what you need to make it possible.


### What Is a Strategy Model?

Your strategy model has three layers that work together.

`[MAIN PANEL: Strategy model template showing three layers]`

**The Business Model Layer** - Your validation experiments and execution activities. This is what you're doing to test and build your business model. Your validation plans from the last three sections become this layer.

**The Organizational Layer** - What needs to happen organizationally to make your business model strategy possible. Team, structure, partnerships, assets.

**The Capital Layer** - Where funding enters to enable your organizational and business model strategies. When you need it, how much, from whom.

These three layers interact and influence each other. They're not built separately - they work as a system. 
 

And they're laid out across a timeline: two months, six months, eighteen months.

### The 2/6/18 Month Timeline

This timeline structure gives you the right balance between planning and flexibility.

**Two months** - This is your detailed, committed plan. You know exactly what you're doing, who's doing it, what resources you need. This is tight and specific.

**Six months** - This is your likely next steps if your two-month experiments go according to plan. Still specific enough to be useful, but with the knowledge that you'll learn things in the first two months that might change this.

**Eighteen months** - This is your longer arc. Where you're heading if things continue to progress. You know this will change, but it gives you direction and helps you see inflection points.

`[VISUAL TEXT: 2 months = detailed plan | 6 months = likely next steps | 18 months = longer arc]`

This structure lets you be thoughtful and strategic while staying flexible and adaptive to new learning.

As you move from idea and early stage through to growth and scale stages you will stretch out your timeline to reflect the longer-term planning that you need to do as you transition from experimentation to execution. But the 2. 6. and 18 month model is an ideal balance of structure and flexibility for early stage ventures.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,336
You've done the hard work and hard
thinking to create your validation

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:06,666
plans for your customer model,
impact model, and economic model.

3
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:10,402
You know what assumptions need testing
and how you're gonna test them.

4
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:13,651
Now you need to bring it all
together into one coherent

5
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:15,673
strategy that you can execute on.

6
00:00:16,235 --> 00:00:18,240
This is what the strategy model is for.

7
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:22,625
It takes your validation plans and
turns them into an execution roadmap.

8
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:26,950
It shows you what happens when,
in what order,  what resources

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,270
you need to make it possible.

10
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:32,117
Your strategy model has three
layers that work together.

11
00:00:32,526 --> 00:00:37,253
The business model layer, your validation,
experiments, and execution activities.

12
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:41,659
This is what you're doing to test and
build your business model, your validation

13
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:43,759
plans from the last three sections.

14
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,156
Become this layer, the
organizational layer.

15
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,593
What needs to happen
organizationally to make your

16
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,393
business model strategy possible?

17
00:00:52,682 --> 00:00:55,390
Team structure, partnerships, assets.

18
00:00:56,099 --> 00:01:00,213
The capital layer We are funding
enters to enable your organizational

19
00:01:00,213 --> 00:01:01,743
and business model strategies.

20
00:01:02,132 --> 00:01:06,510
When you need it, how much and
from whom these three layers

21
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,640
interact and influence each other.

22
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:10,381
They're not built separately.

23
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:12,031
They work together as a system

24
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:17,232
and they're laid out across a timeline,
two months, six months, and 18 months.

25
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,467
This timeline structure gives
you the right balance between

26
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:22,177
planning and flexibility.

27
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,563
This is your detailed committed plan.

28
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,890
You know exactly what you're doing,
who's doing it, what resources you need.

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,020
This is tight and specific.

30
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:32,335
Six months.

31
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:37,166
This is your likely next steps if your two
month experiments go according to plan.

32
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,000
Still specific enough to be useful,
but with the knowledge that you'll

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,880
learn things in the first two
months, that might change this.

34
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:45,363
18 months.

35
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,038
This is your longer arc
where you're heading.

36
00:01:48,038 --> 00:01:51,255
If things continue to progress,
You know this will change,

37
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:54,694
but it gives you direction and
helps you see inflection points.

38
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:59,511
The structure lets you be thoughtful
and strategic While staying flexible

39
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:01,041
and adaptive to new learning.

40
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:06,629
As you move from idea and early stage
through to growth and scale stage,

41
00:02:06,695 --> 00:02:10,205
You'll stretch out your timeline
to reflect the longer term planning

42
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:14,756
that you need to do as you transition
from experimentation to execution.

43
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:19,734
But the two, six and 18 month model
is an ideal balance of structure and

44
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:21,969
flexibility for early stage ventures.
