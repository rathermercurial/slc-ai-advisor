# Venture Stage Model

## Overview

The Venture Stage Model is a comprehensive framework that maps the evolution of social ventures across four distinct development stages. This model integrates three parallel tracks - Customer Model, Impact Model, and Economic Model - alongside organizational development milestones to provide a holistic view of venture progression.

The model recognizes that social ventures must simultaneously develop their understanding of customers, refine their impact approach, validate their economic sustainability, and build organizational capacity as they mature from initial idea to scaled operation.

## The Four Venture Stages

### Idea Stage
The conceptual foundation phase where ventures establish their core hypothesis and begin initial validation work.

**Characteristics:**
- Founders doing all key work and decision making
- Little to no formal funding
- Focus on discovery and initial model development
- Heavy emphasis on learning and iteration

### Early Stage  
The validation and early traction phase where ventures test their models and begin building operational capacity.

**Characteristics:**
- Founders still doing all key work but starting to bring on early team members
- Some grants, seed funding, or accelerator/incubator support
- Transition from pure discovery to validation and early implementation
- Beginning of formal systems and processes

### Growth Stage
The scaling preparation phase where ventures prove their models and build infrastructure for expansion.

**Characteristics:**
- Transitioning from founder-centric to larger, more formal organization
- Key functions/divisions taking over from founders in areas like Finance, Product Management, Operations
- More structured funding through venture capital, larger grants, and government funding
- Focus on proving unit economics and preparing for scale

### Scale Stage
The mature operation phase where ventures have formal business structures and are focused on maximizing impact and sustainability.

**Characteristics:**
- Building out other business functions to operate at scale
- Ongoing incremental innovation to drive economies of scale
- Funding for scaling infrastructure
- Sophisticated impact measurement and reporting systems

## The Three Model Tracks

### Customer Model Track
Focuses on developing deep understanding of customers, their problems, and creating solutions that generate strong product-market fit.

**Progressive Development:**
- **Idea Stage:** Customer discovery and initial problem validation
- **Early Stage:** Solution design and customer-solution fit testing
- **Growth Stage:** Product-market fit achievement and customer base expansion  
- **Scale Stage:** Formal business structure delivery of customer model components

### Impact Model Track
Concentrates on developing, testing, and proving the venture's theory of change and impact measurement capabilities.

**Progressive Development:**
- **Idea Stage:** Hypothesis and focus development around impact
- **Early Stage:** Testing and sharing impact model with stakeholders
- **Growth Stage:** Learning, proving, and refining impact measurement
- **Scale Stage:** Formal impact measurement and reporting business function

### Economic Model Track
Addresses the financial sustainability and business model validation of the venture.

**Progressive Development:**
- **Idea Stage:** Identifying potential revenue sources and basic economic assumptions
- **Early Stage:** Focusing on opportunity validation and initial channel testing
- **Growth Stage:** Proving unit economics and demonstrating growth potential
- **Scale Stage:** Formal business structure with established economic model components

## Stage-Specific Focus Areas

### Idea Stage Focus
**Customer Model:**
1. Developing your customer model first pass
2. Early customer discovery work on customer jobs, UVP, and solution
3. Iterating the customer model based on customer discovery improving the business model

**Impact Model:**  
1. Initial ideas about impact
2. Articulate how impact solution will contribute to system change
3. Back of the napkin logic linking activities to impact
4. Completed impact model in Social Lean Canvas

**Economic Model:**
1. Identifying potential revenue sources
2. Developing your economic model first pass  
3. Early design work and validation on channels, revenue, costs, and your advantage assumptions
4. Credible confidence in strength of the economic model

**Organization:**
1. Founders doing all of the key work and decision making
2. Likely little or no formal funding

### Early Stage Focus
**Customer Model:**
1. Customer-job fit validation
2. Early product/service prototypes
3. Iterating the customer model based on product feedback
4. Problem-solution fit
5. Revenue generation
6. Job-solution fit

**Impact Model:**
1. Iterating impact model based on evidence from engagement with stakeholders
2. Share impact model hypothesis
3. Identify indicators of impact

**Economic Model:**
1. Iterating the financial model based on validation data
2. Testing channels
3. Revenue and cost actuals indicate that the financial model will work
4. Market sizing shows growth potential

**Organization:**
1. Founders still doing all of the key work and decision making but starting to bring on early team members
2. Some grants, seed funding, or accelerator/incubator support

### Growth Stage Focus
**Customer Model:**
1. Iterating product/service delivery
2. Customer-solution fit optimization
3. Developing marketing strategies
4. Growing customer base
5. Product-market fit achievement

**Impact Model:**
1. Developing measurement and evaluation of impact model
2. Gathering data and iterating and refining impact model based on real data
3. Communicating impact to stakeholders and the main growth market

**Economic Model:**
1. Evolving financial model based on growth/customer numbers
2. Activating channels at scale
3. Positive unit economics demonstrating that the economics work and that they can go beyond early adopters to access main growth market

**Organization:**
1. Transitioning from founder-centric to a larger, more formal organization with key functions/divisions taking over from founders in Finance, Product Management, Operations, etc.
2. More structured funding - venture capital, larger grants, and government funding (if required)

### Scale Stage Focus
**Customer Model:**
- Formal business structure with customer model components delivered by formal business functions including Product Management, Marketing, Customer Engagement, etc.

**Impact Model:**
- Formal impact measurement business function
- Sophisticated impact measurement and reporting established
- Managing for impact using data insights to inform decisions

**Economic Model:**
- Formal business structure with economic model components delivered by formal business functions including Strategy, Finances, Capital raising, etc.

**Organization:**
1. Building out other business functions to operate at scale
2. Ongoing incremental innovation to drive economies of scale  
3. Funding for scaling infrastructure

## Application to Social Lean Canvas

This venture stage model directly informs how social entrepreneurs should approach completing and iterating their Social Lean Canvas at different stages of development. The model provides:

1. **Stage-Appropriate Focus**: Understanding what elements of the canvas to prioritize at each stage
2. **Validation Sequence**: A logical progression for testing and refining canvas hypotheses
3. **Milestone Framework**: Clear indicators for when to advance to the next stage
4. **Resource Allocation**: Guidance on where to invest time and resources based on stage
5. **Risk Management**: Understanding the key risks and validation requirements at each stage

## Implementation Guidance
