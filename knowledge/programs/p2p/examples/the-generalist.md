- **Start:** Side project on Substack in **2019** → full-time **Oct 2020** → own site **Jan 2021** ([homepage](https://www.generalist.com/)).
    
- **What it is:** Deep-dive tech/business media: longform essays, research series, podcast, and databases (e.g., [_Future 50 (2025)_](https://www.generalist.com/p/future-50-2025)).
    
- **Monetization:**
    
    - **Premium membership** (_Generalist+_) – paywalled research/databases ([membership page](https://www.generalist.com/plus) or see [About](https://www.generalist.com/about)).
        
    - **Sponsorships** on free posts (see sponsor slots on recent free pieces like _Future 50_ above).
        
    - **Podcast / brand extensions** that reinforce the membership loop.
        
    
- **Scale / team:** Six-figure subscriber base; operates with a **very lean team** (see [company LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-generalist/) for rough headcount).
    
- **Why it’s a strong solo-preneur case:** Solo-first, leverage-heavy IP; recurring “tent-pole” series; clear premium value prop; layered revenue without a big staff.
