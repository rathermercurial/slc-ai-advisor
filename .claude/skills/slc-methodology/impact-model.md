# Impact Model

The Impact Model uses an 8-field causality chain (Theory of Change) to articulate how your activities lead to meaningful social impact.

## The Causality Chain

```
Issue → Participants → Activities → Outputs → Short-term Outcomes → Medium-term Outcomes → Long-term Outcomes → Impact
```

Each field answers a specific question in the chain:

## Fields

### 1. Issue

**Question:** What social problem are you addressing?

**Guidelines:**
- Be specific about the problem, not your solution
- Include scope (geographic, demographic)
- Reference data/statistics if available

**Example:** "In rural Kenya, 40% of smallholder farmers lose crops to preventable diseases due to lack of access to agricultural expertise."

### 2. Participants

**Question:** Who are the stakeholders involved in creating change?

**Include:**
- Primary beneficiaries (who receives direct benefit)
- Secondary beneficiaries (indirect benefit)
- Partners and collaborators
- Community members

**Example:** "Smallholder farmers (primary), agricultural extension workers (partners), local cooperatives (collaborators), farming families (secondary)"

### 3. Activities

**Question:** What do you/participants do to address the issue?

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on actions, not outcomes
- Be specific and measurable
- Include both your activities and participant activities

**Example:** "Train farmers in mobile app usage, deploy crop disease identification AI, connect farmers with extension workers via chat"

### 4. Outputs

**Question:** What are the direct, countable products of your activities?

**Characteristics:**
- Quantifiable and immediate
- Direct result of activities
- NOT behavior change or impact

**Example:** "500 farmers trained, 10,000 disease diagnoses performed, 2,000 chat consultations completed"

### 5. Short-term Outcomes (0-1 year)

**Question:** What changes occur in participants' knowledge, attitudes, or skills?

**Types:**
- Knowledge gains
- Skill development
- Awareness increases
- Attitude shifts

**Example:** "Farmers can identify 5 common crop diseases, 80% report increased confidence in crop management"

### 6. Medium-term Outcomes (1-3 years)

**Question:** What behavioral changes result from short-term outcomes?

**Types:**
- Behavior change
- Practice adoption
- Decision-making improvements

**Example:** "Farmers apply preventive treatments within 48 hours of disease detection, 60% adopt new planting techniques"

### 7. Long-term Outcomes (3+ years)

**Question:** What sustained changes in conditions result from behavior change?

**Types:**
- Condition improvements
- System-level changes
- Sustained behavior

**Example:** "Crop loss rates reduced by 50%, farmer incomes increased by 30%, knowledge sharing embedded in community practices"

### 8. Impact

**Question:** What is the ultimate change in the world you're contributing to?

**Characteristics:**
- Broad, systemic change
- Often shared with other organizations
- Aligned with SDGs or other frameworks

**Example:** "Reduced poverty and food insecurity in rural East African farming communities"

## Visual Summary

| Field | Timeframe | Type | Example |
|-------|-----------|------|---------|
| Issue | Current | Problem | 40% crop loss |
| Participants | Current | Stakeholders | Farmers, extension workers |
| Activities | Ongoing | Actions | Training, AI diagnosis |
| Outputs | Immediate | Deliverables | 500 trained |
| Short-term | 0-1 year | Learning | Can identify diseases |
| Medium-term | 1-3 years | Behavior | Apply treatments promptly |
| Long-term | 3+ years | Conditions | 50% less crop loss |
| Impact | 5+ years | Systemic | Reduced poverty |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Outputs ≠ Outcomes:** "100 people trained" is an output; "people apply training" is an outcome
2. **Skipping the chain:** Each step should logically lead to the next
3. **Unmeasurable impact:** Even aspirational goals need indicators
4. **Attribution confusion:** Long-term impact is contributed to, not solely caused by you
5. **Forgetting participants:** Change happens through people, not just programs

## Relationship to Purpose

The **Issue** field often mirrors or expands on the **Purpose** section:
- Purpose = Why you exist (mission statement)
- Issue = The specific problem you address (with context and scope)

Keep them aligned but distinct.
