The Core Framework conclusion wraps up the improvement work you've done across all three models. It reinforces the critical message: if you have doubts about your business model being good enough, fix it now.

After the Core content, we'll pull together the key P2P themes and bridge into Strategy.

**Tag line:** **Wrap and bridge.**

## P2P COMMENTARY

**[MAIN PANEL: Text overlay - "P2P Improvement Themes"]**

**Script (spoken):**

Let's land the key themes that ran through this whole section for p2p Ventures.

**Tag line:** **P2P themes.**

### Three Key Themes

**[MAIN PANEL: Three themes visual]**

First, scale works differently for you. You don't need millions of customers. Small can win. 1,000 customers at the right price point. Focused beachhead. Efficient impact intervention. Lower breakeven. Small by design is a strategic advantage.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Small can win | Design for your scale]**

Second, your constraints are filters, not limitations. They narrow your options to what actually works. Go narrow in customer segments. Partner for impact delivery. Use organic channels. Choose accessible leverage. Constraints focus you on models that work at your scale.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Constraints → Focus → What works]**

Third, optimize for efficiency. Most effective path, not most comprehensive. Use AI to accelerate research and analysis throughout. Design for your capacity - build what you can actually operate solo or with a small team.

**[VISUAL TEXT: Efficiency | AI acceleration | Your capacity]**

**Tag line:** **Different lens, better fit.**

### Ready for Strategy

**[MAIN PANEL: Transition toward Strategy section]**

You now have a business model worth testing. Time to validate your assumptions and test your model in the real world.

That's Strategy. That's next.
