Now your economic model, how you achieve financial sustainability while delivering your impact model

`[MAIN PANEL: Social Lean Canvas - highlight Economic Model section]`

You can have the best customer and impact models in the world. But without economics that work, you don't have a sustainable venture.

### The Two Jobs

As we discussed earlier, your economic model has two main jobs in these early stages.

First: Can your business model produce positive unit economics?

Second: Can it grow to the size you need it to be?

In order to take your next steps in the canvas process, you need your economic model to be good enough to take forward. Like with your customer and impact models, this doesn't have to be complete or perfect. After this step, you're going to start validating your business model, and it will evolve from here anyway.

But at this stage, it does need to go beyond your back-of-napkin starting point and be able to demonstrate enough potential to justify putting time and effort into it.

### Quick Diagnostic Check

Before we dive in, ask yourself these questions about your economic model:

Can you clearly show how you will produce positive unit economics?

Do you know your breakeven point and the path to get there?

Do you understand what needs to be validated in your channels to reach enough customers?

Is there leverage in your model, or is it purely linear?

`[VISUAL TEXT: positive unit economics? | breakeven path? | channel validation? | leverage?]`

If you're hesitating on any of these, your economic model probably needs some work. Red flags include negative margins, unrealistic scale assumptions, and no clear understanding of costs.

# Assessing your Economic Model 
## Assess Job Number One: Positive Unit Economics

Let's start with the first job - producing positive unit economics.

As your venture evolves, your revenue and costs sections start to form your financial model. 

`[MAIN PANEL: Economic Model section - highlight Revenue and Costs]`

Unit economics involves figuring out that on every sale of a product or service you make, you earn more money in revenue than it costs you to deliver that product or service.

This is called positive (or negative) gross margin.

Here's a simple example. Say you sell boxes of apples.

For every box of apples you sell for ten dollars, it costs you eight dollars to pick the apples, buy the box for the apples, pack them in the box and deliver the box to the shop. These are your costs of goods sold - COGS.

This gives you a positive gross margin of two dollars per box. Or a twenty percent gross margin. This is positive unit economics.

`[VISUAL TEXT: $10 revenue | $8 COGS | $2 gross margin (20%)]`

### Understanding What "Unit" Means

Now, in this example, one box of apples is the unit. But depending on the type of business you are, you'll calculate your unit economics differently.

An airline will treat each seat sold as one sale. One unit.

A car dealer will look at one car sold.

Uber will look at one hour of ride time.

Zoom might look at one year of subscription.

Each will have a different way of calculating unit economics, but the principle is the same. How much do you earn from each unit and what do they each cost to produce?  

So think about your business model. What is your unit? What does one sale look like for you?

### Fixed Costs and Breakeven

Once you've worked out your unit economics, you need to factor in the other costs you have that don't change with every sale. These are the fixed costs you have regardless of how many boxes of apples you sell.

Things like the rent for the land the apple orchard is on. The cost of pruning all the apple trees. The rent on the packing shed where they all get put into boxes.

When you know what your gross margins are, you know your fixed costs, you can then calculate how many boxes of apples you have to sell for ten dollars before the money you make on each box covers all of your fixed costs.

This is your breakeven point. Before this, you're losing money. After this, you're in profit.

`[MAIN PANEL: Simple breakeven graph showing fixed costs line and cumulative gross margin line intersecting]`

Being able to calculate this will help you understand the scaling dynamics of your business model. How big does your venture need to become before your gross margins are enough to cover the fixed costs of the business and you become sustainable?

### Assess Your Unit Economics

So look at your financial model and make sure that there is at least good potential for positive unit economics.

If you're showing negative gross margins - if your revenue per unit is less than your cost to deliver that unit - you have a fundamental problem that needs fixing now.

`[MAIN PANEL: Return to Economic Model section]`

<span style="color:red">**CLAP**</span> 
## Assess Job Number Two: Can You Grow?

Now let's look at the second job. Can your business model grow?

Your economic model also needs to show that you can grow. It's one thing to have a model that looks profitable on paper. But if you can't attract enough customers to get past breakeven, then it doesn't matter how good your unit economics are.


### You don't have to be huge

This is not to say that your venture has to scale to become a huge enterprise. Sometimes small is the right size.

But scale matters for financial sustainability. Looking at your unit economics will start to give you a sense of how big your business model needs to get for you to reach financial sustainability - where revenues are coving COGS and Fixed Costs


### Margins Matter

Here's a rule of thumb. Low-margin businesses like supermarkets and online retailers need significant scale to make the economics work. Whereas high-margin businesses, like luxury goods, can sustain a business model at much smaller scale.

A good example of this is the beer industry. Twenty years ago, most beer was mass-produced, high-scale, low-margin beer. In this world there were a small number of very big beer producing companies. 

Then the emergence of craft beer allowed boutique brewers to break even at much smaller scales. Why? Because craft beer - following the artisanal food trend - shifted part of the beer market from low-margin mass production to a high-end and higher-margin business. Rather than making 50cents each on a million bottles of beer, a smaller brewer could now breakeven making $3 on 50,000 bottles of beer.  

`[VISUAL TEXT: high scale/low margin → small scale/high margin]`

So if you can create premium positioning for your venture, you might not need massive scale to become sustainable.

### Is Your Market Big Enough?

We covered market size in the section on customer model, where we looked at TAM times ARPU.

That calculation - Total Addressable Market times Annual Revenue Per User - gives you your revenue potential.

The question now is: does this match your breakeven requirements?

If your TAM times ARPU doesn't get you past breakeven, you have a problem you need to fix. Either find a larger customer segment or figure out how to charge them more money. 

`[VISUAL TEXT: TAM × ARPU ≥ breakeven?]`

### Can You Reach Enough Customers?

Now, your TAM might be big enough, but can your channels reach enough of these customers?

Often ventures can have easy access to early adopters through existing relationships and other low-cost channels. But this all changes when you try to scale to your broader market.

The critical question is: Do you understand what needs to be validated in your channels?

Talk to advisors who understand the channels you're planning to use. Consult AI research tools to map out how effective you think your channel or channels will be and how much they will cost.

You're not validating yet - validation is your next step. But you need to understand what you'll need to validate.

`[MAIN PANEL: Highlight Channels section]`

### Which Channels Need to Scale?

Depending on the different customer types you have, some channels will need to scale and some won't.

For example, if you have one customer who is both the user and the payer, then you'll need one or more channels that will deliver all of your customers. These channels need to be scalable and repeatable.

However, if you have say, a user customer type as well as a payer, and the payer is a single large government agency, then you'll need a scalable channel to reach your users. But not to reach the government agency.

That might just be a one-off sales effort and the ongoing maintenance of the relationship with the government agency. That one doesn't need to be scalable and repeatable. 

### Pirate Metrics - Mapping Customer Acquisition Flow

For your scalable channels, you can lay out the customer acquisition flow and start to understand whether it can provide you the customers you need to make your business model work.

Use the Pirate Metrics model to map this customer acquisition flow.

`[MAIN PANEL: Pirate metrics funnel diagram - AARRR]`

It's called Pirate Metrics because the acronym is AARRR. It stands for:

**Acquisition** - customers discover your product or service.

**Activation** - they engage with your product or service.

**Revenue** - they pay you.

**Retention** - they come back and pay you again.

**Referral** - they tell others about you, creating new acquisition.

`[VISUAL TEXT: Acquisition | Activation | Revenue | Retention | Referral]`

Using the Pirate Metrics model, you can start to make assumptions about you customer acquisition flow. 

These numbers will start as a high-level sketch, but they give you an idea of how your channels will need to perform to get your business model to work. You'll make these assumptions more accurate as you test them in validation.

### A Rich Way to Experiment

This can be a rich way to experiment with different ideas inside your business model.

For example, if your model can't afford to pay for your acquisition channel at the scale you need, then you might need to innovate on how to improve your retention rates. It might be cheaper to retain customers than to acquire new ones.  

Perhaps there's a subscription or membership model you could use that would keep customers coming back without having to acquire new customers every time.

# Understanding Leverage - The Multiplier

Now we need to talk about what makes an economic model truly powerful. This is about leverage.

### The Purpose-Driven Venture Trap

The issue with purpose-driven ventures is that often they evolve out of a nonprofit mindset or background.

The thinking is: "If only I can add an income stream to the impactful things that I'm doing, I can become financially sustainable."

This leads people to create weak models that are marginal at best and more often are outright failures.

Understanding the levers that produce efficiency and scale in a business model, and adding some of this leverage into your business model, is crucial to not falling into this trap.

### The iPhone Thought Experiment

Let's explore with a thought experiment.

Think about this question: Why can't the richest person in the world buy a better phone than I can?

Think about this. They can clearly buy better cars, better houses, better food than I can. But - assuming that I can buy the latest consumer iPhone - why, even if they spent ten million dollars of their own money developing it, can't they buy themselves a better phone?

Think about why there are no high-end phone companies. Apart from those companies that just stick diamonds to iPhones.

`[PAUSE - allow 3-4 seconds for reflection]`

The iPhone is the most financially successful product in the history of business. It's arguably the best phone ever made. And while it's expensive, it's affordable to a large portion of the world's population.

How is this possible? Unlike luxury cars, yachts, and houses...

`[PAUSE - allow 3-4 seconds for reflection]`

### Business Model Leverage

It's possible because of a thing called business model leverage.

There are things that Apple does within its business model that have the effect of multiplying the value of the iPhone compared to what it costs for them to produce it. 

`[MAIN PANEL: Simple diagram showing leverage multiplier effect]`

Things like...

Their hugely expensive design effort being funded out of the sale of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of iPhones sold every year.

They own the App Store and have millions of developers working for free on products that make their product - the iPhone - more valuable.

They design and build the whole phone, from the chip to the handset to the software, allowing them to create efficiency and performance advantages throughout the whole platform.

They integrate the iPhone into a whole ecosystem of other products like the Apple Watch, iPad, iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV, and so on - that all make the phone more valuable. Imagine if someone had to buy all of these other businesses just to get their phone to work well.

`[VISUAL TEXT: design leverage | platform leverage | ecosystem leverage]`

You get the idea. All these different "levers" create a machine that massively increases the value of the phone while simultaneously lowering the cost of producing it.

And this dynamic is so powerful that even the richest person in the world can't get themselves a better phone, no matter how much they spent.

In fact, the only real way for them to make a phone as good as the iPhone would be to build their own version of Apple that itself could benefit from the business model leverage like Apple does.

### What Is Business Model Leverage?

Let's break down this business model leverage into its simplest form by asking the question: what is a business model actually doing?

The answer is: it's taking some resources and creating something out of them that is more valuable than these resources are on their own.

This increase in value is a form of leverage. A multiplication of the value of the resources through the magic of the business model.

Here's a simple example. If you take one hundred dollars worth of wood and spend four hours of your time - which you value at twenty-five dollars per hour - and make a table, you have consumed two hundred dollars worth of resources. That's wood and labor.

Then if you can sell the table for four hundred dollars, your "business model" has created two times leverage. It has converted two hundred dollars of resources into four hundred dollars of value for your customer.

This can also be expressed as a one hundred percent gross margin.

`[VISUAL TEXT: $200 resources → $400 value = 2× leverage (100% margin)]`

The greater the leverage, the more powerful, and more likely to succeed, your business model becomes.

### Types of Leverage

Let's look at the different ways that leverage works in a business model. You can then think about how you could use different forms of leverage to make your business model better.

`[INSERT: Types of Leverage videos from EUSIC - this should become its own slug with the leverage videos, then return to this content]`

### Patagonia - Leverage for Purpose-Driven Ventures

Patagonia is a good example of using business model leverage to achieve an impact goal while making the business model better.

In nineteen ninety-four, they wanted to switch to organic cotton for their clothing products. They became increasingly aware of the massive environmental costs of producing cotton using existing methods.

But when they looked into it, they found that their business model couldn't handle the extra costs of using organic cotton.

But they made it work using a couple of different forms of business model leverage.

First, they captured a small price premium from being organic. This is brand or perceptual leverage. 

And second, by developing new technology for processing organic cotton that massively reduced the cost of organic production. This is technology leverage.

This combination of being able to charge slightly more and at the same time reducing the cost of production enabled the business model to deliver the environmental benefits that they were going for and end up in a stronger, not weaker, position.

`[VISUAL TEXT: brand premium + tech innovation = impact + stronger economics]`


Use the business model leverage lens to understand what is strong about your current business model. And also where the opportunities to add leverage to the model might be.

# The Improvement Process

Here's how to actually work through improving your economic model.

**First, as with the other models - gather input.** Talk with advisors, experts, and team members. Show them your canvas. Talk them through how your whole business model fits together, but focus in on your economic model. Gather feedback on where they think the weaknesses are and what improvements they'd suggest.

Use AI tools to explore possibilities. They can help you think broadly about different options that you can then narrow in on.

Also look in the canvas example library for ventures that are in a similar space to you and see how they found an economic model that works.

**Second, work through systematically.** Work through each canvas box in your Economic Model. Based on the ideas we've just talked through and feedback from advisors, brainstorm possible changes you could make.

`[MAIN PANEL: Economic Model section with boxes highlighted in sequence]`

**Third, test ripple effects.** For each idea you have that you think has potential, zoom out.

First, consider the rest of the economic model. How would these changes affect how the economic model functions as a system?

For example, if you swapped out a customer acquisition channel - say you switched from a direct sales channel where you're selling to big box stores and shifted to an online model - what effect would this have on your revenue and costs?

Would this change how much you could charge for your product? How would this change your cost model now that you don't have to support inventory at many stores or a team of salespeople, but you now need to fund online sales channels?

Then, if an idea is looking positive, zoom out to your business model as a whole. What implications would this change have on your impact model and your customer model? What would have to change across your whole business model?



Would this make your business model better as a whole?

**Fourth, document alternatives.** Once you've done this, make a list of ideas that you've generated. Prioritize the ones you want to explore further and flesh out a Social Lean Canvas that incorporates each new idea.

This gives you a stable place to work from as you develop your strategy.

### Readiness Check

You're ready to move on when you can confidently answer these questions:

Can you demonstrate positive unit economics, even if approximate?

Do you know what your breakeven point looks like

Do you understand the channels you will take to reach enough customers?

Can you identify at least one form of leverage in your model?

`[VISUAL TEXT: positive unit economics | breakeven path | channel validation plan | leverage identified]`

If yes, create a list of your core economic assumptions that you are making in your economic model. You'll need these when you start validating.
